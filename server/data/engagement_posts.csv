***FACT CHECK*** (These claims have been proven false by medical professionals!!) Supreme Court Justice #ClarenceThomas continues to find himself in the midst of intense controversy and backlash—and this time it surrounds his false claims regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. During his dissenting opinion at a hearing of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas alleged that current COVID-19 vaccines contain the cells of aborted children which has been proven to be untrue.
________________________
@Politico reports while hearing a case in the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas once again spouted false claimsregarding COVID-19. After the Supreme Court declined to hear a religious liberty challenge to the New York City vaccine mandate involving 16 health care workers Thomas incorrectly stated that COVID-19 vaccines contain the cells of “aborted children.” In his full statement on the matter he said of the Supreme Court “They object on religious grounds to all available COVID–19 vaccines because they were developed using cell lines derived from aborted children.”

To be clear none of the current COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. contain any cells of aborted fetuses. Clarence Thomas attempted to make the correlation between cells obtained from elective abortions decades ago that were only used in the testing phase of the COVID vaccine development process—which is highly common practice in vaccine testing — including testing for rubella and chickenpox vaccinations.

Speaking at his final White House press conference before stepping down as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Chief Medical Adviser to President Joe Biden Fauci sounded the alarm not only urging testing and vaccination but contending that the “real danger” will be among unvaccinated Americans.

“But the people who are most at risk are the unvaccinated.  I mean we have — 68 percent of our population is vaccinated.  You know that means that we have 32 percent of the population that’s not” he said.

That data coincides with the findings of September’s survey from The Economist/YouGov indicating that three in ten Americans have not received a coronavirus jab. Fauci however cited general data asserting that unvaccinated individuals are more at risk for hospitalization or death. However he did not mention the growing instances of vaccine-related complications including “the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination” as detailed by a Florida Department of Health analysis leading the state to update its guidance on mRNA vaccines recommending against them for men under the age of 40.

“And if you look at the data they are just profoundly striking of the curves of death and hospitalization of unvaccinated versus vaccinated versus vaccinated and boosted” Fauci claimed adding “So there is a relatively smaller difference in vaccinated and unboosted versus vaccinated plus boosted.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get boosted.”",instagram_1509241|2978101801689366420

The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.

Biden is also signing an executive order to require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government — with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.

Biden was to announce the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new “action plan” to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots that has raised doubts among the public over his handling of the pandemic.",instagram_447424|2659203217030642710

The teacher assumed the symptoms indicated allergies not infection the investigators found.

However the teacher was reportedly unmasked on occasions when reading aloud in class"" the report read. Eventually 27 people including the teacher were infected. None were seriously ill and all recovered. Those cases that were analyzed involved the Delta variant of coronavirus although the researchers said they were not necessarily able to test everyone who may have been infected in the outbreak. The CDC highlighted the case as an example of how schools need to follow all recommendations if they want to protect students and staff.

While the actress drew attention to the designer office furniture a photo hanging on the wall ended up stealing the show.

The photo depicts a naked child stuffed awkwardly into a box with legs crammed together at uncomfortable angles and what appears to be a look of discomfort on the child’s face. It remains unclear who the photographer is and what the piece is meant to represent.

In her original Instagram post the actress revealed she tested positive for COVID. She also explained why she posted a picture of her office though she didn’t address the bizarre photo in the background.

“Ok. This is a weird post. But I have Covid so f*ck it. During one of the SAG nomination panels for @everythingeverywheremovie I told the story of how I ended up with my office furnished with my beautiful Pollack chairs from that movie” she wrote.

During a segment on CBS Mornings psychologist Lisa Damour was asked how hosts should address people’s vaccination or non-vaccination status over Thanksgiving dinner. “It might be a difficult conversation before people step into your house to say ‘whoa wait a minute where’s your card what’s your status?’ before you walk into my home'” a host said.

“This is tough because people are all over the map on this” responded Damour. “They’re also all over the map with their risk tolerance. But the rapid tests have made this a lot easier. Whatever people’s vaccination status is we can actually confirm safety on the spot.”

“If the situation feels weird maybe make it kind of fun” she continued. “And say ‘we’re going to start with hors d’oeuvres in the garage. You know we’ll have drinks we’ll do our rapid tests and then come on in’ right?” You can make it playful make it fun and then be able to enjoy the holiday because you’re not worried about safety.”

Damour’s suggestion was just one other over-the-top suggestion in a string of over-the-top suggestions. Axios for instance recommended on Tuesday that homes should have “Thanksgiving bouncers” to sift through the non-compliers.

“No one really wants this job but millions of households may need their own Thanksgiving bouncer. The cover charge is a negative COVID test done ahead of arrival or outside the front door” the article said. “Normalizing rapid tests is a practical way to help extended families feel a little more normal around the holiday dinner table.”",instagram_1509241|2714756816686777585

It seems like a serious warning this time and it could mean an end to the rampant practice of borrowing a family member's or friend's — or loose acquaintance's — login information.

Netflix said it estimates more than 30 million U.S. and Canadian households are using a shared password to access its content. The company said more than 100 million additional households were likely using a shared password worldwide.

In its quarterly shareholder letter Netflix acknowledged it has purposefully allowed generous out-of-home password sharing because it helped get users hooked on the service. But with competition from Disney Warner Bros. Discovery Paramount Global NBCUniversal Apple TV+ and other streamers eating into its growth Netflix said it wants the millions of households sharing passwords to start paying.

""Our relatively high household penetration — when including the large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition is creating revenue growth headwinds"" Netflix said in its letter. ""Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn't changed much over the years but coupled with the first factor means it's harder to grow membership in many markets — an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth.""

Netflix reported a loss of 200000 paid subscribers in the first quarter ended March 31 — the first time in more than 10 years Netflix has lost subscribers during a quarter. The company projected it will lose 2 million more subscribers in the second quarter.

The streaming platform currently has 222 million subscribers worldwide. It enjoyed booming growth during the pandemic but that customer surge has subsided — and now turned negative — as Covid-19 quarantines have largely lifted.",instagram_447424|2820955256286123569

“I would note first that former President Obama has been a huge advocate of individuals getting vaccinated” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during the daily briefing.

Nearly 700 people are expected to mingle during the party according to reports including at least 200 staff and 475 invited guests creating fears of a coronavirus “super-spreader” event on the island.

Psaki defended the Obama birthday bash noting that it would be held outdoors and that Martha’s Vineyard was in a “moderate” spread zone identified by the CDC. She also said that Obama’s event would have some level of testing for the virus for attendees.

Pearl Jam is expected to perform at the event that will be held outdoors on Obama’s $12 million property at Martha’s Vineyard.

Martha’s Vineyard boards of health last week issued a mask advisory for anyone unable to maintain social distance or while indoors presumably anyone attending the party.

Psaki referred additional questions from reporters about the event to Obama and his staff.

“We certainly advise everyone to follow public health guidelines which I know the former president who is a huge advocate of getting vaccinated of following the guidance of public health experts would certainly advocate for himself as well” she concluded.

President Joe Biden is not expected to attend the event according to the White House.",instagram_1509241|2631681479752435765

As Breitbart News has reported over the last few weeks Biden has been accused of using Pennsylvania as a transportation spot for border crossers and illegal aliens where flights are charted in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Most recently former Rep. Lou Barletta (R) @loubarletta_pa — now running for governor in Pennsylvania — accused Biden of flying border crossers and illegal aliens to eastern communities in the state. Barletta said:

First we had to discover for ourselves that illegal immigrants were being shipped into northeast Pennsylvania on at least four flights. But then when people demanded information the flights were shifted to the Lehigh Valley and they just hoped no one would notice.

This week in statements to the media Gov. Tom Wolf (D) seemingly confirmed Biden’s secret migrant flights to Pennsylvania but excused them as merely a stopping point for passengers’ final destination which remains unknown.

a Wolf spokesperson told Fox News:

Had any of the elected officials sending letters/statements asked they would have received the same information that we have from HHS; over recent weeks unaccompanied children passed through the Wilkes-Barre airport en route to their final destination to be unified with their parents or vetted sponsor.

Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA) who sent a letter to the Biden administration requesting information on the secret migrant flights told Fox Business Channel Biden was actually siphoning funds allocated for coronavirus testing and using it to fly border crossers and illegal aliens into the U.S.

“The idea that they would do this attempt to do it secretly clandestinely in the middle of the night. There were two flights that came in on Christmas night in the evening at nine o’clock at night” Meuser said:",instagram_1509241|2744938520525293778

Yeah well like everything else that was a lie as well. 🔴 President Joe Biden plans to meet with his coronavirus team on Tuesday as cases of the virus spike to record highs in the United States

A record 1017376 people in the United States were diagnosed with the virus on Monday according to case trackers.

The vast majority of the daily cases per capita reported on Monday come from New York followed by the northeastern region of the country followed by the south and the midwest.

In Washington DC reports of new infections are up about 800 percent over the last two weeks according to the New York Times. In New York City new cases have increased 600 percent.

The president continues struggling to address his failure to “shut down the virus” as he vowed to do in 2020.

The president and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with the administration’s coronavirus team led by Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday afternoon.

Biden faces increasing questions about his failure to deliver monoclonal antibody treatments to states as the case of the virus surge to record highs.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized the Biden administration for controlling the supply of monoclonal antibody treatments and pausing or slowing distribution to states.

“We’re in a situation where we’ve now asked for 40000 more every week. Because I have people that I could help and they are holding onto it and they’re not distributing it in the way we need it to be distributed” DeSantis said on Fox News Monday criticizing “Biden and his cronies” in the federal government.

The president also faces criticism for failing to ramp up coronavirus testing quickly enough as shortages have led to long lines at testing centers around the country.

Biden has remained silent about the virus since a video conference call with U.S. governors on December 27 where he admitted there was “no federal solution” to solve the coronavirus.",instagram_1509241|2743752685406537181

The Biden administration did not mandate any of the migrants to be vaccinated before their release. The source informs Breitbart Texas that the figures only include those migrants who were tested by ICE.

The source not authorized to speak to the media says the migrants ranged from infants to the elderly. A Department of Homeland Security document reviewed by Breitbart Texas reports the oldest released migrants were over 85 years old. Nearly 1300 were under the age of ten.

Nearly 12000 of the migrants who tested positive for COVID-19 and were released into the U.S. were between 18 and 40 years of age more than 11800 were male nearly 1300 were under the age of ten and more than 6000 were between 20 and 29 years old.

According to the source the releases occurred in multiple cities across the United States between January 2021 and early October.

The totals do not include the thousands of untested migrants released directly by the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol testing of migrants has been limited to unaccompanied migrant children later turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As reported by Breitbart Texas the Border Patrol relied on non-government organizations to test migrants after their release from detention. Many of those migrants were later released to self-quarantine at hotels within border cities.

The source says the positive tests did not factor in the decision to release. “With the pace of referrals from the Border Patrol we tested made the migrants aware and released them to avoid increasing the detained population” the source revealed. “None of the migrants received the COVID-19 vaccine either voluntary or forced.”",instagram_1509241|2686763724809551756

Among the 450000 underwater borrowers in the third quarter nearly 60% had mortgages originated in the first nine months of 2022 Black Knight found. That's about 1 in 12 homes purchased in 2022 with a mortgage or 8%. Nearly 40% of homes bought this year have less than 10% of equity left to tap.

Over 200 residents in the homes died amid the pandemic and Gov. Phil Murphy’s (D) administration was heavily criticized in April last year after instructing the homes not to turn away patients who tested positive for the illness.

The order was eventually rescinded according the the NBC article.

In May 2020 New Jersey Democrats were silent regarding Murphy’s decision to place coronavirus patients in nursing homes Breitbart News reported at the time.

“The rising problem of coronavirus deaths prompted New Jersey state Senate Republicans to call for an investigation into the coronavirus outbreak at New Jersey nursing homes” the outlet said.

In September last year approximately 100 people gathered outside Veterans Memorial Home at Menlo Park to demand an investigation into the virus deaths NJ.com reported. The Justice Department later issued a letter to Murphy asking about its nursing home death count saying it was launching an investigation into the state’s veterans homes “after receiving what it described as incomplete answers to an earlier request for data” the NBC report continued.

In the beginning of the pandemic the state took measures to protect long-term care facilities such as veterans homes from liabilities for basic negligence if they were thought to be acting in good faith amid the health emergency.

The move “raised the bar” for possible lawsuits according to attorney Scott Piekarsky who is with a firm representing multiple families of veterans who previously lived inside the Paramus facility and whose claims accused it of gross negligence.

“These weren’t easy slam dunk cases but we felt we had enough and we were going to stay the course” Piekarsky told NBC adding “The state did the right thing in not putting these families through years and years of litigation.”",instagram_1509241|2736953565991934288

Newsom said the emergency declaration would help support the state's vaccination efforts. Demand for the vaccines has outstripped supply as infections rise. Staff at sexual health clinics and other sites have struggled to keep up with the influx of people seeking the shots.

California is mobilizing personnel from its Emergency Medical Services to help administer the vaccines. Newsom said the state is working across all levels of government to slow the spread through testing contract tracing and community outreach.

California's declaration comes after Illinois declared a public health emergency earlier Monday. New York declared a state disaster emergency in response to the outbreak late Friday.

The U.S. has reported nearly 6000 cases of monkeypox across across 48 states Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak has spread swiftly since health authorities in Boston confirmed the first U.S. case in May.

California Illinois and New York – home to the nation's three largest cities – have reported 47% of all confirmed monkeypox infections in the U.S. New York is the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. with nearly 1400 confirmed cases as of Monday.

The Biden administration is weighing whether to declare the a public health emergency in the U.S according to senior federal health officials. This would help mobilize resources for state health officials that are battling the outbreak. The last time the U.S. declared a public health emergency was in response to Covid-19 in January 2020.

CNCB reports that Netflix shares closed down more than 35 percent on Wednesday after the streaming giant’s earnings report on Tuesday that showed it had lost subscribers for the first time in ten years — and expected to lose more. The company warned shareholders that it was likely to lose another two million subscribers in the next three months. “Our revenue growth has slowed considerably” Netflix told shareholders on Tuesday.  The major drop in subscribers caused Netflix to lose more than $50 billion off its market cap. The streaming giant is now the worst-performing stock of 2022 in the S&P 500 down 62.5 percent year-to-date. Netflix cited multiple issues for its poor growth including increasing competition and the lifting of pandemic restrictions that had previously boosted the platform’s viewership.

Netflix also pointed to password sharing as a major issue estimating that 100 million households are sharing their subscription with family or friends. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has previously described the practice as “something you have to learn to live with” adding that in many cases password sharing is “legitimate” between family members.

Hastings stated on Tuesday that password sharing was making it increasingly hard to attract new subscribers in some countries. “When we were growing fast it wasn’t a high priority to work on [account sharing]. And now we’re working super hard on it” he told shareholders.

Netflix may sool roll out payment plans it is testing in Latin America worldwide. The aim is to have users pay slightly more in order to add extra account profiles and allow password sharing. “The principle way we have is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service outside their homes” said Greg Peters Netflix’s chief product officer.",instagram_1509241|2822075888448750101

The incident occurred at the Starbucks outlet at 1490 Blackwood Clementon Road in Gloucester Township where the food handler had reportedly worked multiple days this month while contagious. The department was notified of the infection on Nov. 17 whereupon it inspected and then subsequently shuttered the coffee shop — despite finding no evidence of food safety violations.

“The county health department has been working closely with the patient and the staff at the Starbucks to address the situation” Camden County Health Officer Paschal Nwako said in a statement. “The patient is not currently working and close contacts have been identified.”

That particular Starbucks location according to the company “is busy as most are” county spokesman Dan Keashen told CNN. “They’re saying they have an average of 600 patrons a day and some are return patrons maybe going multiple times a day … but the exposure is probably in the thousands.”

As a result anyone who visited the location on Nov. 4 5 6 11 12 or 13 is being urged to get the hepatitis A vaccine “as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after contact” per the press release.",instagram_447424|2712830862453331778

The pill ""should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of Covid-19 and within five days of symptom onset"" according to an FDA statement.

Paxlovid combines a new antiviral drug named nirmatrelvir and an older one called ritonavir and is administered as three pills given twice a day for five days.

Police forcibly cleared the demonstrators in China’s financial capital who called for Xi Jinping’s resignation and the end of the Chinese Communist Party’s rule — but hours later people rallied again in the same spot and social media reports indicated protests also spread to at least seven other cities including the capital of Beijing and dozens of university campuses.

Largescale protests are exceedingly rare in China where public expressions of dissent are routinely stifled — but a direct rebuke of Xi the country’s most powerful leader in decades is extraordinary.

Three years after the virus first emerged China is the only major country still trying to stop transmission of COVID-19 — a “zero COVID” policy that regularly sees millions of people confined to their homes for weeks at a time and requires near-constant testing. The measures were originally widely accepted for minimizing deaths while other countries suffered devastating wavs of infections but that consensus has begun to fray in recent weeks.

Then on Friday 10 people died in a fire in an apartment building and many believe their rescue was delayed because of excessive lockdown measures. That sparked a weekend of protests as the Chinese public’s ability to tolerate the harsh measures has apparently reached breaking point. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered late Saturday in Shanghai which experienced a devastating lockdown in the spring in which people struggled to secure groceries and medicines and were forcefully taken into centralized quarantine.",instagram_1509241|2980868786420464693

“I woke up and — it’s weird I never get sick and when I do it’s not very bad — I had the body aches” Ortega said. “I felt like I’d been hit by a car and that a little goblin had been let loose in my throat and was scratching the walls of my esophagus.”

Netflix confirmed Jenna's story and added in response: “Strict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed production removed Jenna from the set.” But many have criticized the producers and series director Tim Burton for allowing Ortega to work when she felt so unwell.

It lasted a little over 2 weeks before I was negative. I went on with business as usual but I felt tired and weak figuring it was obviously due to laying around and sleeping while having Covid. As time past symptoms began to culminate which started with nausea and lower back pain. This commenced my frustrating journey with providers and prescribers. After receiving Rx for nausea which didn’t resolve my GI issues I was referred to a GI specialist. All typical procedures were administered and I left with a Dx of mild reflux and received Rx which didn’t resolve my nausea. Next was numerous visits with a cardiologist with all test scans and blood work ordered with no results to explain why I was having pains and palpitations. I was told to eat healthy and lose some weight. I eventually went to see and eye doctor due to having occasional blurred vision headaches and the brain fog . Nothing significant was found other than needing rx for readers . After having experiencing 12+ symptoms for nearly 8 months  I was able to see a specialist who is conducting research for Covid pts. They are still learning but he did say that he has pts that have reached 85-95% full recovery. He ordered a CT scan of my head with no complications or inflammation detected. During this year long journey many of my symptoms subsided. The only symptoms that have been lingering were GI and nausea issues dull headaches and feeling tired with muscle and joint pain after physical activity. I began over the counter regiment of probiotics after consulting with my PCP. I don’t know if it’s finally running its course or if the probiotics are working but now  my GI issues and nausea are almost gone! I want everyone to know that it’s going to be different for all of you but just know as of today I finally walked into my gym for the first time in a year without feeling all my symptoms. Sure I’m not as strong and my endurance isn’t what it was before this but I finally feel like I’m 95-97% back to feeling like myself again! Do not give up and remember  slow progress is better than no progress! Keep the faith and hope and eventually you will feel your symptoms improve with time! Keep the faith and I’ll continue to pray for all of you for a speedy and full recovery! I sincerely aim for this post to give you all hope and encouragement! 🙌🏼😊🙏🏼🙏🏼,facebook_13487526|659297722077647

This can cause individuals to engage in compensatory behaviors to justify their actions. Individuals that have cognitive dissonance exhibit hypocrisy where they avoid certain behaviors while simultaneously engaging in related activities. 
 
Some avoid vaccination despite engaging in behaviors with similar mechanisms and/or greater potential adverse health effects. Three examples are smoking Botox injections and tattoos. 
 
Smoking is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes including COPD Coronary Artery Disease and 17 different cancers. Smokers who refuse vaccination exemplify dissonance as smoking has known negative effects on human health whereas vaccination prevents potentially deadly illness. 
 
Botox injections are used for a variety of medical conditions where they can be an important treatment option.

Botox is a toxin from Clostridium botulinum a bacterium that causes Botulism an illness with up to 20% mortality rate. Botox is administered by injection of the toxin the component of the bacterium responsible for the symptoms of Botulism.

While this is similar to receiving a vaccine (in which a weakened or killed microbe is introduced into the body) there’s a key difference: Botox is NOT weakened – it is the actual toxin that is responsible for disease. Knowing this those receiving Botox despite refusing vaccination are exhibiting both cognitive dissonance and hypocrisy as the two procedures both involve injection of a foreign agent and carry the risk for adverse events. 
 
The process of tattooing involves the injection of ink droplets into the dermis of the skin. This process produces an inflammatory immune response in the skin as the ink is treated as a foreign body. Many of the pigments used today are not FDA approved or regulated for safety. Tattoos are another example of a foreign substance being injected into the body producing an immune response and carries a risk for adverse outcomes however unlike vaccines tattoos persist indefinitely whereas vaccine components are cleared rapidly from the body.",instagram_14845281|2627780534172845596

Rapid COVID tests only appear positive when your body has a certain amount of virus which means they may not detect COVID cases that don’t reach that threshold. But just because your rapid test takes a while to turn positive ⁠— or doesn’t at all ⁠— it doesn’t mean you’re free of infection or that your test is a fraud. There are many factors that can lead to a negative test when you have COVID including your vaccination status and how accurately you perform the test. If you have symptoms and test negative on a rapid test Dr. Emily Landon suggests you confirm that result with a PCR test or take another rapid within the next two days.

I’m still in the middle of processing it all. Then yesterday my employer and I had an honest conversation about me not being sure about if I could return to work after my FMLA (12 weeks) is up at the end of the month. I still have minimally 8 medical appointments per week… and I don’t see the number dropping anytime soon. My employer suggested applying for long term disability offered through them as soon as possible. Unfortunately our plan is employer funded so the 60% I receive will be taxable. While I don’t have to worry about COBRA until the end of September I don’t think i can survive with 60% of my current income… Come December my daughter and I will have to move as our lease will be up and we won’t be able to afford our apartment by ourselves… (right now thankfully my ex-bf has offered to continue to pay until the lease is up.) There are so many unknowns and I’m so scared… Part of me knows that it will probably be best for me to focus on healing. But financially I don’t know if i can afford it… I have exhausted all my savings even my 401(k) and I just received more medical bills… I haven’t even shared this with my friends on Facebook but I decided to share with you here because I know so many of you are going through this and I could use some encouragements. As some of you know I’m more than 17 months in post Covid… The symptoms continue to be debilitating - like severe fatigue cognitive decline neuropathy cramping muscle aches sound/pressure sensitivity ear fullness loss of balance repeated hair loss lingering cough palpitations low grade fever shortness of breath and the list goes on…. But since I decided to find joy in my life I can say that even these symptoms the break up even having to make this difficult decision cannot take my joy from my life. They are still very difficult and I cry often but I have decided that I still can live differently than before and find light in every day. I know it was just a matter of shift in focus. So the picture is of me still trying to find joy in these trying times but also being gentle to myself when I’m not okay.. This is where I am today. For everything else like the things that are out of my control I will let go and let faith guide me. 🙏✨ P.S. Just so that you know I appreciate everything my ex-bf has done for me and my daughter this past year. Without him I don’t know how we would have gotten through!

That’s right today I am finally able to go out with my own hair – no wigs no half-wigs no toppers. After nine long months I was able to go to the hair salon yesterday. I experienced hair loss —it’s one of the symptoms you go through during what they call “long-haul Covid”. One of many many symptoms. I have a little residual cough and feel tired sometimes but that’s about it. Praise God I am well! My doctor says one thing but my God says another. I am not one to take medications. Never have been. In fact my husband and I believe that this past year was not about recovering from Covid rather I was detoxing from all the medication given me during hospitalization. My doctor didn’t believe so and basically gave up on me and referred me to a pulmonologist. She believed I may have a lung disease I would have to live with the rest of my life. The last thing I needed was more drugs so I went on a mission. I decided I would become a self-advocate so I started to pray and seek out alternative natural remedies. My chronic joint and muscle pain has completely dissipated with the use of a (high potency Curcumin) turmeric supplement. My energy is back. No more chronic fatigue and malaise! That was taken care of with a mitochondrial cell energizer supplement. Along with lots of herbal teas like raw ginger root lemon honey peppermint etc. I began the protocol from Frontline doctors and taking supplements Naturopathic doctors recommend. It worked. They took various blood tests lung tests CT scans etc. All of them came back negative. A little scarring (hence the residual cough) but that’s all. I even got rid of that annoying post nasal drip. The pulmonologist had referred me to an allergist and she prescribed four different medications to take along with Claritin. Five sprays up my nose? —No way! I did not take any of them. Instead I waited for the test results of 32 different allergies. All of them came back negative. And now my hair is growing back before they said it would. Just in time for my 60th birthday. Thank God for His mercy and grace. Be encouraged my friends. Doctors in Western medicine just do what they were taught and are “practicing“ medicine. They do not have all the answers.

It may be effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variant including future ones that could evolve to evade existing vaccines.⁠
⁠
Vaccines have been critical for containing the covid-19 pandemic but their efficacy may wane as the coronavirus that causes it mutates. Ke Cheng at North Carolina State University and his colleagues wondered if they could create a barrier for the airways that temporarily blocks the virus from causing infections. This could protect people against new variants while new vaccines are developed or old ones updated.⁠
⁠
First they created a powder made of polymer and gelatin microparticles. When inhaled this enters the mucus lining of the nasal passage and lungs swelling to form a gel layer that blocks viral penetration.⁠
⁠
When tested in mice the powder’s particles remained at high levels in their lungs for 8 hours blocking the virus from causing an infection with up to 75 per cent efficiency with no safety concerns.⁠

I first had it in January 2020 before testing was available and it was a terrible 6 week ordeal. My second time I tested positive March 26 2021 I didn't even know I had it. My only symptom was an upset stomach that lasted a week. I tested negative April 7th. I had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine May 18th. I just tested positive for the 3rd time this past Thursday. Once again I had no idea I had it because I am only having the symptoms of allergies. It took about two days after my positive test to show other symptoms which are the loss of taste and smell (what a bizarre feeling by the way! This is the first time I lost it)I called my dr office on Wednesday to get my allergy medicine called over to the pharmacy and they asked me to come get tested. I was outraged because u had just gotten the vaccine and I am still within the 90 day immunity period. They called me an hour later to tell me I was positive and I absolutely lost it I bawled my eyes out and argued the results. The dr later called me to tell me my pcr came back positive. I still didn't believe it so I made an appointment at Walgreens for a third test and that also showed positive. I called the cdc because I want answers. Every medical professional is extremely confused as to how this happened. The cdc can't even explain it. They told me they will have to call me back because they need to talk to their supervisor about it. Really feeling defeated here right now. Any input on this would be appreciated!,facebook_13487526|508188083855279

""My mom couldn't afford to take her three boys to the barbershop so she cut our hair herself"" he says. ""She did a terrible job. Finally when I was 10 and she sat me down for my regular cut I grabbed her wrist and asked 'Ma can I cut my own hair?'""

But the road from that first cut to becoming a professional barber was not an easy one. 

""I wish I could say that I graduated from high school and went straight to barber school but I took a few detours"" says Waverly now 50. ""Including drug and alcohol addiction and four years of living on the street. I was still homeless when I heard I could get financial aid to attend barber college so I enrolled.""

After undergoing addiction treatment Waverly opened his first shop in 2008. He is now the owner of @urbankutzbarbershop and an instructor at @labarberiabarbercollege.

Waverly's shop quickly transformed into something more than just a place for a cut.

""I started to hear about people I’d known who had passed away from preventable or treatable conditions"" he says. ""I started to share my own health struggles with my clients — for one thing how I gradually lost 150 pounds and eliminated my need for high blood pressure medication.""

Waverly started working with local hospitals to offer health screenings for anyone who would come into his shop — not just clients. Earlier this year the shop offered COVID-19 vaccines and Waverly continues to talk to community members about exercise nutrition and self-care. 

He knows firsthand that free screenings like the ones he offers can save a life.

""In 2015 I attended a Cleveland Clinic health fair and a routine urine test revealed traces of blood"" Waverly says. ""I felt fine but I followed up with my doctor and learned I had kidney cancer. Surgery saved my life. I’m not an organized-religion guy but I’m spiritual. I know I’m blessed to be here and I want my clients and neighbors to be just as blessed."" 📸 by: @billydelfsphoto

10,niniandthebrain,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/p/CYFKHWMvxm3/,"I keep getting this question so I want to clarify. There is absolutely a very small sliver of a chance that your positive rapid test is wrong (false positive: you are told you are infected when you are not) but considering that you need higher viral loads for this test to turn positive the probability of this is infinitely small (~.1-1.5%). These tests are roughly 98.5-99.9% specific (or higher) --> this is for BINAXnow tests but others are quite similar.

PCR on the other hand has a higher chance of being negative even when it is the most sensitive (around the period where symptoms are present). This is partly because it depends on sample collection and the time when the test is taken.

We must also consider the prevalence of disease and symptoms. When prevalence is high and one has symptoms likelihood of positive Antigen test being right increases as is right now. 

Therefore it is way likely that your positive rapid test is correct than your negative PCR is. It's just basic statistics. This is especially true if 1) you have had an exposure or 2) you have symptoms 3) high case rates.

When symptoms are present please stay home

 I have already explained in detail why your rapid test might be negative even if you are infected. If your rapid is falsely negative it may be because 1) you aren't contagious yet (data pending for Omicron but we will go with what we have) as viral loads are still low AND/OR 2) your pre-existing immunity means symptoms kick in much sooner than viral loads climb (and potentially keep viral loads lower for a bit longer).

If you have had an exposure quarantine until you can rule out infection. If you have symptoms please isolate regardless of a negative test. I wish we had more tests.

24,unbiasedscipod,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/p/CYEdPQxLSJ-/,"Somewhat related to the newly updated CDC guidance (we have more on that coming soon we promise).

Rapid tests and their utility have been discussed by us and others as a screening tool for immediate use just prior to interacting with others.

However it’s important to understand their limitations. Rapid tests return very low rates of false positives (meaning if you get a positive result you can trust that it is reliable) but high rates of false negatives. The false negatives are due to the fact that the testing window for rapid tests is very narrow – if you test too soon in the course of infection you may get a negative result even though you are infected.

That being said – we need to normalize not exposing others to communicable diseases – whether it’s COVID-19 or something else. If you are highly symptomatic but got a negative result on a rapid test – you should still be isolating. With the current rampant spread of Omicron if you are physically ill with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 assume it’s COVID-19 and isolate. Even if it isn’t COVID-19 and is a different respiratory illness you shouldn’t be exposing people to those either.

Now more than ever we all need to be responsible individuals and help keep our communities safe.

15,u.s.surgeongeneral,instagram,https://www.instagram.com/p/CaALsUgOKG0/,"This weekend my 4 y/o daughter tested positive for COVID-19. She’s had a fever and sore throat and she isn’t her usual bubbly self. But thankfully she is eating drinking and breathing fine. We’re keeping a close eye on her. Worrying about her has prompted a few reflections:

Trying to isolate a small child from her 5 y/o brother and parents in a small home is pretty tough. Which is why I’m grateful that my son my wife and I are all vaccinated. Even if we contract the virus it’s unlikely to cause severe illness because we have protection

While our child will likely be ok given she’s young and otherwise healthy I know parents with higher risk kids may worry more. Few things are worse than worrying about your child’s health. The more we all get vaccinated and take precautions the more we can protect all our kids.

I wish a vaccine was available for my child and for all kids <5. It would protect our kids. It would help parents too. Unfortunately more data is still needed from trials for the @fda to make a complete assessment. A safe effective vaccine for <5s remains a top priority for them.

Staring at my daughter’s positive test I asked myself the same questions many parents have asked: Will my child be ok? Could I have done more to protect her? Was this my fault? In these moments it doesn’t matter if you’re a doctor or Surgeon General. We are parents first.

Parenting during the pandemic has been one of the hardest jobs I could have imagined. I have immense respect for the millions of parents who are grappling with the daily exhausting decision-making that goes into protecting our kids’ health and their education.

The experience of the last few days has reminded me that despite our varied opinions about the pandemic we all largely want the same thing: to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. I hope to remember this the next time I encounter someone with a different point of view. 

Until then hold your kids and your loved ones close. That’s what we will do with our daughter until she’s better and for as long as possible thereafter.",instagram_2059997|2774268794644242868

A treatment that would “functionally cure” HIV might be on the horizon. The single-dose treatment will soon begin human trials.
Excision Biotherapeutics was approved to start testing the new treatment by the Food and Drug Administration back in September. The treatment known as EBT-101 will be given to volunteers with HIV. 

Participants will receive a single dose that will be administered through IV over one or two hours. The volunteers would remain on antiretrovirals for three months after beginning the trial and after three months they will stop ART. Treating physicians will monitor them for relapse or rebound. 
The trial’s goal is to demonstrate safety at all dose levels and whether or not subjects remain HIV negative. Reports state that Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are also running human trials on HIV vaccines. However J&J’s vaccine failed the first round of its trial. 🚧🚦🔥

I have been saying we need  twice-weekly testing to help us resume more activities (along with other layers of mitigation of course). Speed + frequency > accuracy or precision. I will explain why below. PCR to follow up.
 
Dr. Michael Mina has  been trying to highlight the importance of rapid testing and even has a detailed  publication explaining why and how rapid testing is key to help slow spread in certain settings. I give credit to his work for this post. I will link his publication in my linktree.
 
PCR is highly specific (very few false positives) and more sensitive than rapid antigen tests.  Sensitivity is a test's ability to tell us when someone is sick if they really are. When a test is less sensitive it means more people who are sick are told they are not. PCR has been found to be anywhere between 60 and 95% sensitive.
 
The big drawback with PCR is that results take a longer time to receive. While one waits one may infect others if one doesn't quarantine which can be impractical for school-age children as they miss class.
 
Rapid tests may detect less cases accurately but have several advantages: 1) cheaper (although we need even cheaper than current alternatives) 2) you get results within 15 minutes 3) less invasive and 4) detect >90% of contagious cases 5) By repeating them more often you can eliminate some of the uncertainty. In fact it has been demonstrated that twice-weekly testing can capture all events. Assuming kids are not interacting during the weekend by testing children on Monday before school you can easily identify cases sooner (even if not all of them) than PCR before others are infected (this example assumes each infected person can infect 1 or 2 others). Once a case is identified later more kids will need to be quarantined (in this example 5 for each infected kid). With rapid antigen one will receive results the same day but with PCR it won’t be until Wed. resulting in more escape points. A PCR can then be done as follow up.

This is not a blind study and it will be divided into four groups. Two groups will receive a combination of 1644 and 1644v2 and two groups will receive either one vaccine or the other vaccine. The goal is to study the safety of the vaccine and if it can launch a basic immune response. The first phase of the trial will last ~10 months. If phase 1 is successful phases 2 and 3 will be launched. 

mRNA-1644 is a collaboration between Moderna the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Moderna also has another candidate for HIV vaccines mRNA-1574 in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. The company expects to begin phase 1 trials for both mRNA-1644 and mRNA-1574 by 2022. 

mRNA vaccines do NOT contain any parts of the virus. mRNA vaccines contain the blueprint for a protein. This makes the vaccine safer as it is not possible for it to cause infection. Over the decades HIV has mutated numerous times. The mRNA technology allows for easy modification of the vaccine in case of new mutations. 

This vaccine is very promising and the whole world will be watching this trial in hopes of good results. 

Vaccines historically have been the most effective means to prevent and eradicate infectious diseases. They are safe and cost-effective. A preventive HIV vaccine could help save millions of lives.",instagram_14845281|2707653488621863214
32,COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS,facebook,https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/991832924919722,I'd like opinions on if it is safe to be in a lakehouse with 6 friends for a weekend? So I had covid 2/5/21 with very mild symptoms. Tested positive for antibodies after on a blood test at Quest. Well I just tested again and it shows no more antibodies. I already had committed to this memorial weekend getaway with 6 girlfriends I rarely see. Some are not vaccinated (neither am I). We'd be in the car for 3.5 hours and have to share a bedroom. I know it's ultimately up to me and my comfort level but I am interested in two things... 1. opinions on whether you would go? or back out? (just so I can see different perspectives) 2. any science or anecdotes about how likely it is that I might catch Covid again after having mild symptoms no longer testing for antibodies And being unvaccinated.￼￼ Thanks!,facebook_9994459|991832924919722

El último día que las personas recibirán los cheques adicionales de 300 dólares en sus cuentas bancarias será el 26 de junio.

“Para aprovechar nuestro impulso acelerar una recuperación económica completa y lograr que más georgianos vuelvan a trabajar en empleos bien remunerados nuestro estado terminará su participación en los programas federales de desempleo COVID-19 a partir del 26 de junio” dijo Kemp. “A medida que salimos de esta pandemia los residentes de Georgia merecen volver a la normalidad y el plan de recuperación económica anunciado hoy ayudará a que más empleados y empresas de nuestro estado lo hagan"".

Georgia continuará ofreciendo beneficios regulares de desempleo.

“Para que Georgia continúe siendo el estado número uno en el negocio tenemos que ser más productivos de lo que somos ahora” dijo Kemp. ""No podemos hacer eso sin trabajadores y de eso se trata este movimiento"".

Los programas que finalizan bajo el plan incluirán compensación por desempleo pandémico federal asistencia por desempleo pandémico compensación por desempleo de emergencia pandémica y compensación por desempleo de ingresos mixtos.

El Departamento de Trabajo de Georgia cuenta actualmente con más de 250.000 puestos vacantes en la lista y ofrecerá apoyo en línea para quienes buscan empleo incluida asistencia para currículums asesoramiento profesional pruebas de habilidades información sobre ferias laborales servicios de capacitación laboral y programas especiales para veteranos y personas con discapacidades.

Algunos líderes de Georgia han dicho que los beneficios federales han provocado una crisis laboral en todo el estado. Dicen que uno de los factores que contribuyen es que los beneficios federales por desempleo son tan buenos que muchas personas prefieren quedarse en casa antes que encontrar un trabajo.

Georgia es el decimotercer estado en optar por no recibir beneficios federales continuos por desempleo.

2,Survivor Corps,facebook,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1183548855727305,I shared this with my Co-Workers. I am now sharing it with everyone. I just couldn't figure out how to copy and paste from this phone. My Covid Journey started on December 15 2021 and I had no idea that I had been in contact with it yet. My 11 yr nephew said he wasn't feeling well that Morning so I gave him allergy and cold medicine and he sneezed in my face. I sent him to school later that day I received a called he spiked a Temp of 101.4 and made an appt for Covid check. Positive. I know I had to care for my kids so be strong Judy. My 8 year old nephew who is very active kept running all over the house. He and I tested positive on the 20th of December 2021. The little girl didn't get it. Tyler tested positive on the 21st of December 2021. I could not got comfortable on big bed mattress in floor. Nobody knew how sick I was. In the middle of the night the wind felt like it was knocked out of me and on Dec 26 2021 was my first hospital visit. They gave me steroids and nausea medicine and sent me home. I was back in the hospital on Dec 28 2021 my Oxygen was 73. This time they did lots of tests and tried to get my Oxygen levels to go up..nothing so I've been on an Oxygen machine breathing for me daily 24/7. The lack of Oxygen makes it hard to do anything. I know I needed help and reached out to the Gaming Connection and I love the help they have given to cook for my family. I didn't realize how much help I needed. I struggle daily to do the basics. This virus is the Devil. I'm thankful Husband Tyler. (Heaven sent) and kids are okay from the Covid even though the cough does linger. I'm far from being well. I'm taking it one day at a time. They Covid affects each person differently. I know since I've been sick. There have been two angels with me during the nights as crazy as it sounds. One is cold (the male) The other is warm (the female) she woke me up a few nights ago when my breathing was off. Crazy but true. Take this Virus Seriously some of us have harder journeys. Thank you for all your continued help. Indirectly you are have helped me be a better person through this. I love you all. UPDATE: This is far from what most of you call a coronacation. Sadly I'm not well enough to come off Oxygen. A vacation isn't where a person wears oxygen 24/7 among other issues that come from wearing the tubes. Doctor said she will see me on the 28th to recheck me. The next two weeks I'm praying to be able to breathe the air we live in. My life consists of bedroom bathroom kitchen and back again unless I have to get out for appointment. I have yet to have Christmas with my grandbabies and nephews and nieces. I said this once before this virus is the Devil. I pray NONE of you have to experience having Covid like this. When I am well I swear I will never take each breathe for granted. My machine keeps me breathing. #NOTACORONACATION. UPDATE: Hi everyone. My last doctor's appt. was February 4 2022. It was decided at that I would remain on Oxygen because my Oxygen dropped from 93 to 88 in 2 minutes while in the exam room. My recheck was supposed to be on February 17 2022 but due to the weather the clinic cancelled it. That morning before they called I checked my Oxygen and it was 84. I panicked waking Tyler up. During the night my Oxygen cords folded in half because it got caught on drawer while I was getting back into bed. This was scary and now I worry about the nighttime with my Oxygen and levels dropping. I've also lost a lot of hair it happens to some people after they have had Covid. I'm thankful that I have enough hair left to cover the balding areas and praying not to lose more because its thin. The good news is I am able to keep my Oxygen up for 75% to 90% of a day depending on each day. Tomorrow morning is my next recheck and I'm praying for good news in addition to asking about why the Oxygen drops at night. I have my Oxygen on during the nights. In all reality I'm thankful to be alive I was very sick and wish I had reached out for help sooner. As a parent I wanted to be the strong one and I took the hardest fall. I love all of you and once again I thank all who helped my family during this hard time. UPDATE: I am going back to work Monday the only way to know if I'm ready is to try. I am being tested to see how my Oxygen is during my sleep and hopefully I will receive great news. *February 28 2022 I am able to return back to work and not using Oxygen during the day but still use while sleeping. Finally March 25 2022 I am officially off Oxygen. I am still losing my hair and there is tingling everyday in my fingertips that doesn't go way.,facebook_11150438|1183548855727305
