3,unbiasedscipod,https://www.instagram.com/p/CYB5AmULvx7/,instagram,"On 12/27/21 CDC officials announced updated guidance on quarantine and isolation periods for those who are infected or have been exposed to COVID-19. We know this has led to a lot of confusion so let’s break it down.

First these changes are based on current data that show the that majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (the virus that causes COVID-19) occurs early in course of illness from 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and 2-3 days after symptoms develop.

Next the changes themselves. Remember isolation refers to separation of a sick/test positive individual from others whereas quarantine refers to separation of an individual after a known exposure.

First – isolation guidance. 

CDC recommends reducing isolation time from 10 days to 5 days for people with COVID-19 IF ASYMPTOMATIC followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others. This applies ONLY to asymptomatic individuals – so those who’ve received a positive COVID-19 test result but are not physically ill. For those who have physical symptoms at the end of day 5 the guidance remains the same (10 days of isolation).

Next – quarantine guidance.
 
IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO COVID-19 AND YOU ARE: unvaccinated OR more than 6 months out from second mRNA dose or more than 2 months after J&J vaccine AND not yet boosted the CDC now recommends quarantine for 5 days followed by strict mask use for an additional 5 days.
 
IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO COVID-19 AND YOU ARE: vaccinated and have a booster shot you do not need to quarantine but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure.
 
For anyone exposed the best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day 5 after exposure. If symptoms occur individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.

Remember vaccines are our best tool to PREVENT infection illness and death. If you have not yet gotten vaccinated please do so.

Here is my best attempt to answer them. ***Get your kid vaccinated.*** Before I go into boosters only 28% of 5-11 year olds have received the primary series to date. This is abysmally low. The vaccine works is safe and is needed for children. During the Omicron wave 87% of hospitalized children were unvaccinated.

(FIGURE) ***Why do children need a booster?*** Data suggests that this was always a three-dose series we just didn’t know it at the beginning of the vaccine roll-out. The two-dose series is sub-optimal against infection because Omicron is particularly good at escaping neutralizing antibodies—our first line of defense. Among 5-11 year olds two-dose vaccine effectiveness against infection ranges from 30-40%. Unfortunately protection also wanes more quickly against Omicron compared to previous variants like Delta. The CDC presented the graph below last week which showed waning immunity among 5-11 year olds following the trend of adults. (Notice after two doses adults and adolescents reached ~0% effectiveness against infection after five months). (FIGURE) Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease is 68% among 5-11 year olds with the two-dose series. A third dose will make this higher. We don’t know if protection is waning because hospitalizations are a relatively rare event so our confidence in the rate at which effectiveness is (or is not) waning is not strong. The data is just too noisy to have a clear picture. We do have stronger data suggesting the vaccine is slightly waning for 12-17 year olds and theoretically there’s no reason to believe this would be different for 5-11 year olds. ***What are the side effects of a booster?*** In Pfizer’s clinical trial side effects among 5-11 year olds were about the same in dose 3 compared to dose 2. Quite a few kids will experience fatigue headaches and muscle pain.

The vaccine works is safe and is needed for children. During the Omicron wave 87% of hospitalized children were unvaccinated. Even though infection-induced immunity is high among children after Omicron it’s not 100%. And even so there are three big reasons why I wouldn’t rely on this protection (read more here). Occurrence of long COVID19 is also higher among adolescents compared to younger kids and risk is reduced with vaccination. And in general being sick for a week or two is just not fun (for mom dad or kid). Go get your kid vaccinated.\n\n(FIGURE)\n\n***Why do children need a booster?***\nData suggests that this was always a three-dose series we just didn’t know it at the beginning of the vaccine roll-out. The two-dose series is sub-optimal against infection because Omicron is particularly good at escaping neutralizing antibodies—our first line of defense. Among 5-11 year olds two-dose vaccine effectiveness against infection ranges from 30-40%. Unfortunately protection also wanes more quickly against Omicron compared to previous variants like Delta. The CDC presented the graph below last week which showed waning immunity among 5-11 year olds following the trend of adults. (Notice after two doses adults and adolescents reached ~0% effectiveness against infection after five months).\n\n(FIGURE) \n\nVaccine effectiveness against severe disease is 68% among 5-11 year olds with the two-dose series. A third dose will make this higher. We don’t know if protection is waning because hospitalizations are a relatively rare event so our confidence in the rate at which effectiveness is (or is not) waning is not strong. The data is just too noisy to have a clear picture. We do have stronger data suggesting the vaccine is slightly waning for 12-17 year olds and theoretically there’s no reason to believe this would be different for 5-11 year olds.\n\n***What are the side effects of a booster?***\nIn Pfizer’s clinical trial side effects among 5-11 year olds were about the same in dose 3 compared to dose 2. Quite a few kids will experience fatigue headaches and muscle pain.\n\n(FIGURE)\n\n***Myocarditis update?***\nOut of 18.1 million doses administered among 5-11 year olds 20 cases of vaccine-induced myocarditis have been reported to the CDC:\n\n-Of these 14 occurred after dose 2; six cases occurred after dose 1.\n-17 out of the 20 were hospitalized.

Shortly thereafter 19 kids in this age bracket died during a mass shooting in Texas. It suddenly felt silly to send. Our kids need boosters but also much much more. They need to come home after school. They need their community to advocate for their safety. They need to live long prosperous lives. Enough is enough. We can and need to change this insanity.

***boosters for 5-11 year olds***
last week in the middle of monkeypox news the cdc acip met to discuss a covid-19 booster for 5-11 year olds here were the presentations and the agenda ultimately cdc strongly recommended dose 3 for 5-11 year olds five months after dose 2 since then i have received many many questions here is my best attempt to answer them

***get your kid vaccinated***
before i go into boosters only 28% of 5-11 year olds have received the primary series to date this is abysmally low the vaccine works is safe and is needed for children during the omicron wave 87% of hospitalized children were unvaccinated even though infection-induced immunity is high among children after omicron it’s not 100% and even so there are three big reasons why i wouldn’t rely on this protection (read more here) occurrence of long covid19 is also higher among adolescents compared to younger kids and risk is reduced with vaccination and in general being sick for a week or two is just not fun (for mom dad or kid) go get your kid vaccinated

(figure)

***why do children need a booster***
data suggests that this was always a three-dose series we just didn’t know it at the beginning of the vaccine roll-out the two-dose series is sub-optimal against infection because omicron is particularly good at escaping neutralizing antibodies—our first line of defense among 5-11 year olds two-dose vaccine effectiveness against infection ranges from 30-40% unfortunately protection also wanes more quickly against omicron compared to previous variants like delta the cdc presented the graph below last week which showed waning immunity among 5-11 year olds following the trend of adults (notice after two doses adults and adolescents reached ~0% effectiveness against infection after five months)

***what are the side effects of a booster***
in pfizer’s clinical trial side effects among 5-11 year olds were about the same in dose 3 compared to dose 2 quite a few kids will experience fatigue headaches and muscle pain

(figure)

***myocarditis update***
out of 181 million doses administered among 5-11 year olds 20 cases of vaccine-induced myocarditis have been reported to the cdc:

-of these 14 occurred after dose 2; six cases occurred after dose 1
-17 out of the 20 were hospitalized and as of last week 14 fully recovered
-1 death in a male child is being investigated he had a fever 12 days after dose 1 followed by abdominal pain vomiting and death the next day the autopsy confirmed myocarditis and testing did not find evidence of a viral infection

the estimated “background rate” of myocarditis is 02 to 22 per 1 million so among 5-11 year old boys there is a slight increased risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis as shown on the slide below it’s important to note that kids can also get myocarditis from viral infections like sars-cov-2 thankfully vaccine-induced myocarditis continues to be far less severe than infection-induced (truncated)",67,0.0,0.4340070899433685

PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests detect different viral components using different technologies which can influence the test’s speed and accuracy.
 
The PCR (or molecular) test is designed to detect the viral genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in this case the RNA. This lab technique is specifically called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This technique will amplify the RNA so even a small amount of viral RNA can be detected from a sample collected. The ability to detect small amounts of the virus is an advantage of a PCR test compared to a rapid test. However because RNA can persist after a person is no longer contagious with replicating virus known infected individuals may test positive beyond that window.
 
Rapid antigen tests detect the viral nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. This is the most abundant protein of the virus. Rapid tests are an easy more accessible and less expensive option for the public with turnaround time of about 15 minutes. However the test will only detect the viral protein if there is enough in the body at the time of testing. If the person tests too early into their infection there is a possibility of returning a false negative. In one study in California they found that the rapid tests only missed about 10% of lab-confirmed positive cases in their study group. In addition because these tests are self-administered there can be false test results due to improper sample collection and test processing.
 
When deciding on the type of test to use one may be more accessible than the other. Regardless testing is better than not testing! Your healthcare provider may also be able to provide insight on which test is more appropriate. Healthcare providers should consider the context in which the test is being used and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population being tested.

16,unbiasedscipod,https://www.instagram.com/p/CeTgU2Pu04u/,instagram,"A common question that we get is whether or not we can use (and trust) a recently expired at-home rapid COVID-19 test. The answer isn’t a straightforward yes or no so let’s discuss.

All clinical diagnostics (and even supplies we use in laboratory research) have expiration dates. This is because substances can deteriorate and degrade over time. This can be due to the inherent nature of the substance itself or the precise combination or formulation of the ingredients (such as in a COVID-19 test).

When these substances are critical ingredients of a test that require optimal function for reliability the deterioration of them can impact the performance and ultimately accuracy of those tests.

For COVID-19 tests companies submit quality control and regulatory testing data to the FDA that demonstrate performance of the ingredients and the tests themselves are stable and reliable over a certain period of time. For most of these tests that are available and authorized by the FDA that period is typically 4-6 months after manufacture which is why those tests have those expiration dates. This isn’t to say that the tests won’t be reliable beyond that period of time but longer-term testing data aren’t available.

If you have a test that expired only a week or two ago it is safe to assume that the test hasn’t magically degraded to the point of being unreliable. However if your test is a month or more expired we’d recommend erring on the side of caution and using an unexpired test. If you want to be extra sure you can contact the manufacturer of the test itself and see if they have additional data they can share.

Ultimately best practice is to use tests that are within their expiration window to ensure the results are reliable but also remember that other factors can impact this as well: sample collection (and following testing procedure instructions) as well as the timing of when you test can also impact your results. If you haven’t ordered your third round of at-home tests the US government is making 8 more at-home tests available for everyone so be sure to do so!

all clinical diagnostics (and even supplies we use in laboratory research) have expiration dates this is because substances can deteriorate and degrade over time this can be due to the inherent nature of the substance itself or the precise combination or formulation of the ingredients (such as in a covid-19 test)

when these substances are critical ingredients of a test that require optimal function for reliability the deterioration of them can impact the performance and ultimately accuracy of those tests

for covid-19 tests companies submit quality control and regulatory testing data to the fda that demonstrate performance of the ingredients and the tests themselves are stable and reliable over a certain period of time for most of these tests that are available and authorized by the fda that period is typically 4-6 months after manufacture which is why those tests have those expiration dates this isn’t to say that the tests won’t be reliable beyond that period of time but longer-term testing data aren’t available

if you have a test that expired only a week or two ago it is safe to assume that the test hasn’t magically degraded to the point of being unreliable however if your test is a month or more expired we’d recommend erring on the side of caution and using an unexpired test if you want to be extra sure you can contact the manufacturer of the test itself and see if they have additional data they can share

ultimately best practice is to use tests that are within their expiration window to ensure the results are reliable but also remember that other factors can impact this as well: sample collection (and following testing procedure instructions) as well as the timing of when you test can also impact your results if you haven’t ordered your third round of at-home tests the us government is making 8 more at-home tests available for everyone so be sure to do so

Rapid tests and their utility have been discussed by us and others as a screening tool for immediate use just prior to interacting with others.

However it’s important to understand their limitations. Rapid tests return very low rates of false positives (meaning if you get a positive result you can trust that it is reliable) but high rates of false negatives. The false negatives are due to the fact that the testing window for rapid tests is very narrow – if you test too soon in the course of infection you may get a negative result even though you are infected.

That being said – we need to normalize not exposing others to communicable diseases – whether it’s COVID-19 or something else. If you are highly symptomatic but got a negative result on a rapid test – you should still be isolating. With the current rampant spread of Omicron if you are physically ill with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 assume it’s COVID-19 and isolate. Even if it isn’t COVID-19 and is a different respiratory illness you shouldn’t be exposing people to those either.

Now more than ever we all need to be responsible individuals and help keep our communities safe.

30,COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS,https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/1152712692165077,facebook,"If you don’t follow Dear Pandemic and/or Querida Pandemia you may want to take a look. Great easy to understand information. When is the best time to test for COVID-19? 

A: The best time to test for COVID-19 depends on your situation.
➡️ If you were exposed the sweet spot to test is 3-5 days later
➡️ If you develop symptoms test right away
➡️ If testing to leave isolation check for a negative rapid test on day 5 (US guidance)
➡️ If testing before an event test as close to the event as possible. 

TL;DR. A typical COVID-19 infection progresses from exposure to incubation to symptoms to viral clearance. Yet the timing of these phases varies greatly across variants and people (see figures).

While science can’t predict the precise moment you will test positive it can provide a rough window for testing and help you make sense of your results. Your optimal testing strategy should also consider test access turnaround time and how test results will impact your choices.

🧪PCR vs Rapid Antigen Tests: Rapid angigen tests are only positive during the peak infectious period because they require lots of viral protein to light up. PCR tests which detect tiny bits of viral RNA are far more sensitive. They typically catch an infection a day or so before rapid tests and can stay positive for weeks after the infectious period is over. 

Here are some guidelines to help you chart your course:

IF YOU WERE EXPOSED

The US CDC recommends waiting at least 5 days after exposure to test to maximize the odds that the virus has replicated to detectable levels. That said many Omicron cases are detectable 3 days after exposure by PCR or rapid testing and some as early as 2 days after exposure.

If you opt to test early (before Day 5) bear in mind that even PCR can give a false negative at this point. It may be that the virus didnt take off and start making lots of copies YET. If an early test is negative test again 2 days later to rule out an infection. After a full 5 days we can be much more confident in a negative test result. Always take precautions while your COVID status is uncertain.

🤓Nerd Note: Scientists are still figuring out the best sample site for Omicron. Early evidence suggests that saliva PCR may catch Omicron cases slightly earlier than nasal swab PCR and that throat swabs may add a small signal boost.

IF YOU DEVELOP SYMPTOMS

The U.S. CDC recommends testing (with either a PCR or rapid antigen test) as soon as you have symptoms. When symptoms are present PCR performs very well and can catch the vast majority of cases. Rapid antigen tests are less reliable immediately and can take a few days before they turn positive especially with Omicron.

If you are using rapid antigen tests and have only one consider waiting 2-3 days after symptoms to reduce the chances of a false negative test result. Otherwise use one test immediately upon symptom onset and save the other for a re-test in 2-3 days. In the early days you can trust a positive antigen test but not a negative one. Take precautions and isolate yourself from others until you can rule out COVID-19. 

⚠️ Dont wait too long! Viral levels often drop substantially after the first week of symptoms and may no longer be detectable with rapid antigen tests (though likely still by PCR).

IF YOU ARE IN ISOLATION WITH A CONFIRMED INFECTION

The U.S. CDC guidelines include an optional rapid antigen test after 5 days of isolation. If your test is negative you no longer have to stay home but should continue to wear a high quality mask around others until after day 10. If your test is positive you can either continue to isolate for 5 more days or try again for a negative antigen test every 1-2 days. 

For most people it takes 5-10 days to clear enough virus to test negative on a rapid antigen test though it can take considerably longer for those with severe disease or compromised immune systems. A recent study of the Omicron variant in the National Basketball Association found that in half of players their viral load had fallen from high to moderate after Day 5 while the other half were still teeming with virus beyond this point. 

It’s worth noting that isolation policies differ around the world. The UK requires two consecutive negative rapid antigen tests a day apart with the first test no sooner than Day 5 (in England).

⚠️ PCR tests should not be used to determine whether you should end isolation because they can be positive for weeks to months after the infectious period.

BEFORE A GATHERING

Test with a rapid antigen test as close as possible to the gathering for your best chances of catching an infection and sparing others. Fair warning some early infections can slip through the cracks as virus levels may be too low to be picked up by a rapid antigen test at the time you take the test even though you are infected. Antigen testing is therefore a powerful layer of protection but is not foolproof.

Keep calm and test on!

LOS MAL LLAMADOS ANTIVACUNAS .
Desde que comenzó la pandemia hasta esta fecha ya casi llegando al mes de Marzo la confusión de muchos se ha hecho notar  al principio la mayoría  de las personas se creyeron a ojos cerrados todo lo qué los gobiernos  decían  por lo menos en COSTA RICA  los ciudadanos dejaban lo que hacían para escuchar con ansias  cuando llegaba medio día  DE cuantos casos habían en los hospitales de contagios  de COVID 19 y hasta casi adoraban al salvador que los protegía metiéndolos en sus casas sin salir y no permitiéndoles ni siquiera abrir sus negocios porque el virus los podía matar .
Daniel Salas se había convertido en casi un dios para la mayoría de los costarricenses  que hasta  vendían fotos y vasos  con la cara  de este salvador impreso en  ellos. Pero el asunto con el que se nunca se cuenta es que el ser humano tiene  el sentido de raciocinio que todo lo especula y comienza a investigar y es allí donde se caen las mentiras de muchos  no que el virus a quien se le llama COVID 19 NO EXISTIERA porque si bien es cierto mucha gente murió no se considera que en realidad haya sido por este patógeno porque se sabe   y por     testimonio de muchos que no fueron bien atendidos  en los hospitales .
Comenzaron a salir  alternativas para combatir el virus  que posteriormente fueron repelidas por el mismo ministro de salud DANIEL SALAS   sin antes dar una explicación del porque lo hizo solo porque si  nada más . Muchos expertos cuestionaron  la actitud  de dicho jerarca que nunca  se refirió al caso siguiendo a ciegas lo que  decía pero a los que le querían  aconsejar les cerró la puerta y oportunidad de poder  defenderse ante la negativa de dicho ministro.
La ironía de que un virus que se moría con agua y jabón tuviera a un planeta completo  en la caída libre de la desgracia mientras los que estaban capacitados para poder sobrellevar el problema se contradecían y lo siguen haciendo ante la perspectiva de como solucionar el asunto  aquí es donde los que si leen e investigan  se dieron cuenta que esto no estaba bien pero ese es otro tema a relucir .La esperanza surge cuando el 7 de ABRIL  del 2021  a las 9 am un día MIERCOLES  llega a COSTARICA el primer lote de vacunas contra el COVID  19 .
¿Pero aquí surge el primer problema “COMO ES QUE YA APARECE UNA VACUNA TAN RAPIDO CONTRA UN VIRUS TAN MORTAL QUE TIENE AL MUNDO DE CABEZA?” obvio no toda la población iba a comerse un cuento así   LA FDA había autorizado la vacuna  con un sentido de emergencia pero no la había aprobado  el PRESIDENTE DE LA REPUBLICA y los JERARCAS DE SALUD  tampoco presentaron  ni hasta la fecha han brindado un informe sobre el contrato  que la casa farmacéutica en ese entonces PFIZER  había firmado con COSTA RICA acerca de la  VACUNA .
Aun así los ciudadanos  de COSTARICA aplaudían dicho evento esperanzados en que la situación iba a tener fin con las DOSIS  DE ALGO QUE EN REALIDAD NO SE SABIA EL CONTENIDO   solo que no tenia el virus atenuado sino que la vacunita  era una innovación de algo a lo qué los expertos llaman ARN MENSAJERO es decir se comenzaba a experimentar   así es como comenzaron a surgir muchos temas con esta dicha sustancia y muchos estudiosos  no iban a permitir ser inoculados con   la inyección salvadora que según el tico iba a acabar con la crisis que vivía al menos este país pero la sorpresa fue grande cuando un ciudadano ya vacunado le preguntó a MACAYA si  ya podía dejar de usar la mascarilla y su respuesta fue un rotundo NO. Entonces la pregunta surge  ¿para que ser vacunado con algo que no permite  dejar de usar  la mascarilla o tapa bocas “ y peor aun ya cuando alguna gente estaba vacunada  empezaron a contraer el virus y fue cuando el señor DANIEL SALAS QUE YA NO SALIA TANTO POR TELEVISION   DIJO ESTAS PALABRAS ”AUN CON LA SEGUNDA DOSIS LOS VACUNADOS PUEDEN CONTAGIAR A LOS NO VACUNADOS ” pero aun así  increíble diciendo eso ya en este país van por la tercera dosis sigue habiendo restricciones la gente se sigue enfermando de COVID  estando con las tres dosis aquí aparecen los defensores que se oponen ante una obligatoriedad  firmada por el PRESIDENTE para los empleados públicos  y los tildan de ANTIVCUNAS  que aquí queremos enfatizar  que es una vacuna primero que nada  “VACUNA “ según la definición    de OXFORD LANGUAGES  dice que es SUSTANCIA COMPUESTA  POR UNA SUSPENSIÓN DE MICROORGANISMOS ATENUADOS O MUERTOS  QUE SE INTRODUCE EN EL ORGANISMO PARA PREVENIR Y TRATAR  DETERMINADAS ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS .
La lógica aquí no se hace esperar  se investigó a las personas que se oponen a  ponerse la sustancia de ARN MENSAJERO  se les preguntó porque estaban en contra y la respuesta fue obvia  no son antivacunas son anti ARN MENSAJERO  SEGÚN ARGUMENTARON  CON ESTUDIOS REVELADOS DE LA INEFICACIA DE DICHAS SUSTANCIAS  una persona cuerda lo pensaría  según dijeron algunos miembros  de (truncated)",['testing' 'vaccines'],['misinfo' 'latinx'],1,3.141788934619372e-05,2022-10-16 12:41:08.253284,2022-02-19 02:48:01+00:00,14623985|478066340442257,"{'platformId': '235745661340994_478066340442257' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2022-02-19 02:48:01' 'updated': '2022-02-26 18:38:32' 'type': 'photo' 'description': '17/2/2022\nLOS MAL LLAMADOS ""ANTIVACUNAS""\n\nwww.ncrextremocr.com\n#editorial\nLOS MAL LLAMADOS ANTIVACUNAS .\nDesde que comenzó la pandemia hasta esta fecha ya casi llegando al mes de Marzo la confusión de muchos se ha hecho notar  al principio la mayoría  de las personas se creyeron a ojos cerrados todo lo qué los gobiernos  decían  por lo menos en COSTA RICA  los ciudadanos dejaban lo que hacían para escuchar con ansias  cuando llegaba medio día  DE cuantos casos habían en los hospitales de contagios  de COVID 19 y hasta casi adoraban al salvador que los protegía metiéndolos en sus casas sin salir y no permitiéndoles ni siquiera abrir sus negocios porque el virus los podía matar .\nDaniel Salas se había convertido en casi un dios para la mayoría de los costarricenses  que hasta  vendían fotos y vasos  con la cara  de este salvador impreso en  ellos.

Entonces la pregunta surge  ¿para que ser vacunado con algo que no permite  dejar de usar  la mascarilla o tapa bocas “ y peor aun ya cuando alguna gente estaba vacunada  empezaron a contraer el virus y fue cuando el señor DANIEL SALAS QUE YA NO SALIA TANTO POR TELEVISION   DIJO ESTAS PALABRAS ”AUN CON LA SEGUNDA DOSIS LOS VACUNADOS PUEDEN CONTAGIAR A LOS NO VACUNADOS ” pero aun así  increíble diciendo eso ya en este país van por la tercera dosis sigue habiendo restricciones la gente se sigue enfermando de COVID  estando con las tres dosis aquí aparecen los defensores que se oponen ante una obligatoriedad  firmada por el PRESIDENTE para los empleados públicos  y los tildan de ANTIVCUNAS  que aquí queremos enfatizar  que es una vacuna primero que nada  “VACUNA “ según la definición    de OXFORD LANGUAGES  dice que es SUSTANCIA COMPUESTA  POR UNA SUSPENSIÓN DE MICROORGANISMOS ATENUADOS O MUERTOS  QUE SE INTRODUCE EN EL ORGANISMO PARA PREVENIR Y TRATAR  DETERMINADAS ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS .\nLa lógica aquí no se hace esperar  se investigó a las personas que se oponen a  ponerse la sustancia de ARN MENSAJERO  se les preguntó porque estaban en contra y la respuesta fue obvia  no son antivacunas son anti ARN MENSAJERO  SEGÚN ARGUMENTARON  CON ESTUDIOS REVELADOS DE LA INEFICACIA DE DICHAS SUSTANCIAS  una persona cuerda lo pensaría  según dijeron algunos miembros  de (truncated)' 'expandedLinks': [{'original': 'www.ncrextremocr.com' 'expanded': 'www.ncrextremocr.com'} {'original': 'https://www.facebook.com/101995992376464/photos/a.108054691770594/123974833511913/?type=3' 'expanded': 'https://www.facebook.com/101995992376464/photos/a.108054691770594/123974833511913/?type=3'}] 'link': 'https://www.facebook.com/101995992376464/photos/a.108054691770594/123974833511913/?type=3' 'postUrl': 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/235745661340994/permalink/478066340442257' 'subscriberCount': 31829 'score': -68.0 'media': [{'type': 'photo' 'url': 'https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/272987261_123974830178580_2004730187398361992_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=cDAd1lO4FfIAX8rtzif&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AT9GrFu6b0VLdJ9-EWuw3CyUUNxkiuJgfC3cZpTdv_vQPw&oe=621EACAF' 'height': 720 'width': 720 'full': 'https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/272987261_123974830178580_2004730187398361992_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=cDAd1lO4FfIAX8rtzif&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AT9GrFu6b0VLdJ9-EWuw3CyUUNxkiuJgfC3cZpTdv_vQPw&oe=621EACAF'}] 'statistics': {'actual': {'likeCount': 1 'shareCount': 0 'commentCount': 0 'loveCount': 0 'wowCount': 0 'hahaCount': 0 'sadCount': 0 'angryCount': 0 'thankfulCount': 0 'careCount': 0} 'expected': {'likeCount': 21 'shareCount': 10 'commentCount': 9 'loveCount': 9 'wowCount': 3 'hahaCount': 8 'sadCount': 5 'angryCount': 3 'thankfulCount': 0 'careCount': 2}} 'account': {'id': 14623985 'name': '¡MÉDICOS POR LA VERDAD!'

los mal llamados antivacunas 
desde que comenzó la pandemia hasta esta fecha ya casi llegando al mes de marzo la confusión de muchos se ha hecho notar  al principio la mayoría  de las personas se creyeron a ojos cerrados todo lo qué los gobiernos  decían  por lo menos en costa rica  los ciudadanos dejaban lo que hacían para escuchar con ansias  cuando llegaba medio día  de cuantos casos habían en los hospitales de contagios  de covid 19 y hasta casi adoraban al salvador que los protegía metiéndolos en sus casas sin salir y no permitiéndoles ni siquiera abrir sus negocios porque el virus los podía matar 
daniel salas se había convertido en casi un dios para la mayoría de los costarricenses  que hasta  vendían fotos y vasos  con la cara  de este salvador impreso en  ellos pero el asunto con el que se nunca se cuenta es que el ser humano tiene  el sentido de raciocinio que todo lo especula y comienza a investigar y es allí donde se caen las mentiras de muchos  no que el virus a quien se le llama covid 19 no existiera porque si bien es cierto mucha gente murió no se considera que en realidad haya sido por este patógeno porque se sabe   y por     testimonio de muchos que no fueron bien atendidos  en los hospitales 
comenzaron a salir  alternativas para combatir el virus  que posteriormente fueron repelidas por el mismo ministro de salud daniel salas   sin antes dar una explicación del porque lo hizo solo porque si  nada más  muchos expertos cuestionaron  la actitud  de dicho jerarca que nunca  se refirió al caso siguiendo a ciegas lo que  decía pero a los que le querían  aconsejar les cerró la puerta y oportunidad de poder  defenderse ante la negativa de dicho ministro
la ironía de que un virus que se moría con agua y jabón tuviera a un planeta completo  en la caída libre de la desgracia mientras los que estaban capacitados para poder sobrellevar el problema se contradecían y lo siguen haciendo ante la perspectiva de como solucionar el asunto  aquí es donde los que si leen e investigan  se dieron cuenta que esto no estaba bien pero ese es otro tema a relucir la esperanza surge cuando el 7 de abril  del 2021  a las 9 am un día miercoles  llega a costarica el primer lote de vacunas contra el covid  19 
¿pero aquí surge el primer problema “como es que ya aparece una vacuna tan rapido contra un virus tan mortal que tiene al mundo de cabeza” obvio no toda la población iba a comerse un cuento así   la fda había autorizado la vacuna  con un sentido de emergencia pero no la había aprobado  el presidente de la republica y los jerarcas de salud  tampoco presentaron  ni hasta la fecha han brindado un informe sobre el contrato  que la casa farmacéutica en ese entonces pfizer  había firmado con costa rica acerca de la  vacuna 
aun así los ciudadanos  de costarica aplaudían dicho evento esperanzados en que la situación iba a tener fin con las dosis  de algo que en realidad no se sabia el contenido   solo que no tenia el virus atenuado sino que la vacunita  era una innovación de algo a lo qué los expertos llaman arn mensajero es decir se comenzaba a experimentar   así es como comenzaron a surgir muchos temas con esta dicha sustancia y muchos estudiosos  no iban a permitir ser inoculados con   la inyección salvadora que según el tico iba a acabar con la crisis que vivía al menos este país pero la sorpresa fue grande cuando un ciudadano ya vacunado le preguntó a macaya si  ya podía dejar de usar la mascarilla y su respuesta fue un rotundo no entonces la pregunta surge  ¿para que ser vacunado con algo que no permite  dejar de usar  la mascarilla o tapa bocas “ y peor aun ya cuando alguna gente estaba vacunada  empezaron a contraer el virus y fue cuando el señor daniel salas que ya no salia tanto por television   dijo estas palabras ”aun con la segunda dosis los vacunados pueden contagiar a los no vacunados ” pero aun así  increíble diciendo eso ya en este país van por la tercera dosis sigue habiendo restricciones la gente se sigue enfermando de covid  estando con las tres dosis aquí aparecen los defensores que se oponen ante una obligatoriedad  firmada por el presidente para los empleados públicos  y los tildan de antivcunas  que aquí queremos enfatizar  que es una vacuna primero que nada  “vacuna “ según la definición    de oxford languages  dice que es sustancia compuesta  por una suspensión de microorganismos atenuados o muertos  que se introduce en el organismo para prevenir y tratar  determinadas enfermedades infecciosas 
la lógica aquí no se hace esperar  se investigó a las personas que se oponen a  ponerse la sustancia de arn mensajero  se les preguntó porque estaban en contra y la respuesta fue obvia  no son antivacunas son anti arn mensajero  según argumentaron  con estudios revelados de la ineficacia de dichas sustancias  una persona cuerda lo pensaría  según dijeron algunos miembros  de (truncated)",20,0.0,0.4836224403323415

La web Real Raw News describe de la siguiente manera las reuniones habidas entre el presidente de Pfizer Albert Borla con el entonces director del Organismo del Medicamento en Estados Unidos (FDA) el 28 de diciembre de 2019 es decir justo al comienzo de esta ""pandemia"". Mucha atención a este y los siguientes mensajes. En esa primera reunión Borla se queja al jefe de la FDA de que no estaban ganando lo suficiente en los últimos años (16 billones en 2018 el máximo mandatario de esta empresa se llevó 17 millones en 2019 más el beneficio en sus acciones lo que le convierte en el directivo mejor pagado del mundo). Las cúpulas de ambas instituciones acuerdan tener reuniones para aprovechar los beneficios de lo que viene con el Covid y deciden que por el bien de sus planes esas reuniones no tendrán reuniones ni en la sede de la empresa ni en las oficinas del organismo del medicamento y realizarlas EN SECRETO PARA EVITAR QUE EL CONTENIDO DE ESAS REUNIONES LLEGUE A LA SOCIEDAD. (Primer delito pero esperad que hay mucho más). La FDA que es un organismo público aceptó las condiciones de secreto de la firma farmacéutica Pfizer. En esas reuniones el jefe de Pfizer se pone a ""llorar"" a su homónimo en la FDA argumentando que el sistema de patentes actual (que libera las patentes de los medicamentos a los 20 años) les está haciendo perder beneficios. [El artículo especifica más este asunto pero me lo salto para ir a lo esencial]. Bourla le dice a Hahn que sabe que es muy difícil modificar el sistema de patentes para favorecerles pero le ofrece una alternativa: le cuenta que se ha hecho con el genoma de un virus que afecta el sistema respiratorio y que está asolando en ese momento China y que llegará a Estados Unidos en breve. Le cuenta que se extiende por el aire y se propaga rápidamente entre la población infectada que parece peligroso pero que según sus estadísticas el 996% de la población lo supera sin problemas. (Hay que recordar que al principio la OMS y la FDA afirmaron que la tasa de mortalidad del SARS Cov-2 era del 34%. De acuerdo a esta información sabían desde el principio que no era más que una gripe mala). El jefe de Pfizer le cuenta al de la FDA que de acuerdo a sus cálculos en tres años tendrán un beneficio del 15% cada año. ""Puedes usar esos beneficios para repartir regalos (sobornos) o para lo que quieras"" le dijo el jefe de Pfizer al de la FDA. [Continúa]. ""La verdad es que no necesitamos vacuna para esta enfermedad"" le reconoció Bourla a Hahn ""pero es importante que tú hagas creer a tus colegas como Fauci o los jefes de los CDC que la vacuna es imprescindible para evitar una gran mortandad en Estados Unidos. Tenéis que hacer creer esto a la administración Trump: cuanto más rápidamente se apruebe la vacuna más rápidamente se distribuirá y la gente se sentirá segura"". Bourla reconoció un periodo de vacunación de 5 años para asegurar más pinchazos y maximizar el beneficio. ""Cuando la gente empiece a perder el miedo inventaremos una variante del virus para asustar a los ingenuos y que ellos mismos pidan más pinchazos"". En este momento de la negociación Hahn le hace la siguiente confesión a Bourla: otra compañía farmacéutica de la competencia le ha hecho una oferta similar. Sin nombrar al competidor le dice que la autorización de ""uso de emergencia de la vacuna"" será compartida entre varias empresas farmacéuticas y que ""habrá tarta suficiente para todas ellas"" (se entiende que se repartirán los astronómicos beneficios). Esta admisión de Hahn prueba que las compañías farmacéuticas comparten similar ""ética"": el beneficio económico por encima de la salud de las personas. Bourla le dice que está de acuerdo en compartir con otras compañías la autorización de emergencia de la vacuna pero que CUANDO SEA AUTORIZADA ""DE VERDAD"" LA PRIMERA LICENCIA SEA PARA PFIZER (como así ha ocurrido). ""Nos aseguraremos de dar mejores incentivos que nuestros competidores (se refiere a los sobornos claro). Hahn le respondió que consultará con sus asesores. Y lo demás es historia. Ahora viene lo gordo: estos son declaraciones de un alto ejecutivo de Pfizer se supone que dado que lo cuenta Real Raw News y lo anticipó Trump el otro día los militares patriotas tienen toda la documentación de las cuentas bancarias y las personas que han recibido esos sobornos.

Quienes hemos levantado la voz para enfrentar las medidas que con excusa sanitaria socavaban nuestras libertades hubimos de pasar una prueba de fuego: fuimos tildados de conspiranoicos negacionistas nazis antivacunas delirantes y otras lindezas. Hemos perdido amistades espacios radiales y televisivos algunos hemos perdido nuestros trabajos otros se han tenido que vacunar a la fuerza se nos ha censurado a mansalva y cayó el peso de la condena social sobre nosotros y sin embargo todo aquello que no mata fortalece y las denuncias que en su momento hicimos luego se comprobaron verdaderas.

Dijimos que una cosa era morir con coronavirus y otra por coronavirus y el Ministerio de Salud Pública terminó dándonos la razón. Dijimos que el PCR era un test inadecuado para detectar el virus y se terminó asumiendo que daba resultados erróneos. Dijimos que los encierros masivos iban a generar atroces consecuencias económicas sociales y psicológicas y la realidad nos ha dado la razón en toda la regla: aumento de los suicidios de jóvenes perjuicios severos en la educación niños que han sido aterrorizados ancianos que fueron recluidos y sometidos una democracia que llegó a su nivel más ínfimo de expresión y un aumento del costo de vida que sumado a los millones de desocupados amenazan generar una explosión social.

Dijimos que la vacuna de Pfizer era dudosa pues si llegaba por contrato secreto había que desconfiar de ella si te hacían firmar que limitarías tu acceso a la justicia había que dudar de ella y si venía a caballo de una operación la más fraudulenta de la Historia había sobrados motivos para dudar de ella y hoy es el día que la mismísima Pfizer reconoce ante sus accionistas que la vacuna fue ineficiente que generó efectos adversos y que se le mintió olímpicamente a los gobiernos para que la adoptaran.

En ocasiones la ausencia de metas claras hace que un colectivo se vuelva hacia sí mismo en conductas autodestructivas. Pensamos que la ""pandemia"" no terminó desde que lo que importa son las políticas pandémicas y el espacio que ha ganado el autoritarismo y la economía digital en nuestras sociedades. Se pretende imponer un nuevo orden social y para impedirlo nos parece necesario dar una serie de batallas.

1- El contrato secreto con Pfizer continúa secreto y ese contrato es un cáncer en el cuerpo de la República. La lógica de la empresa privada no puede prosperar sobre la lógica del beneficio común y una democracia representativa no puede tolerar que sus representantes firmen condiciones y obligaciones secretas.

2- Los organismos internacionales negocian mandatar a la OMS para desembarcar con sus políticas en caso de emergencia sanitaria sin la necesidad de la anuencia de las autoridades nacionales. Tal como en el caso del contrato secreto con Pfizer UPM y Katoen Natie se pretende erosionar las soberanías nacionales en aras de la creación de un gobierno global.

3- El reconocimiento de Pfizer de que fraguó la información sobre su vacuna para que los gobiernos la adoptaran no ha generado una disculpa pública por parte de los gobiernos y tampoco ha generado el inmediato congelamiento del proceso de inoculación hasta que se evalúe la conveniencia de seguir o no este misterioso tratamiento médico.

4- La censura se impone en el mundo en un proceso que viene de larga data y desde antes de la creación de los organismos dedicados a chequear ""la información verdadera"". La censura se ha venido imponiendo desde que se instala la corrección política y desde que se premian los discursos que promociona la corrección política. El mecanismo de la censura es un mecanismo perverso: cuando uno empieza a reprimir lo que dice termina reprimiendo lo que piensa. La censura se impuso siempre que fue necesario acallar la verdad pues la verdad no precisa de la censura: le alcanza con presentarse sin raros artificios.

24/06/2021 

Una pesquisa en solitario de un prestigioso científico estadounidense ha provocado un pequeño terremoto en la investigación del origen de la pandemia. El bioquímico Jesse Bloom —del Centro de Investigación Fred Hutchinson en Seattle— se percató de que algunas secuencias genómicas de los primeros casos de covid en la ciudad china de Wuhan habían desaparecido de una base de datos internacional. En un trabajo detectivesco deduciendo el nombre de los archivos Bloom logró recuperar la información borrada gracias a que también se había subido a la plataforma Google Cloud un espacio virtual de almacenamiento. “Parece probable que las secuencias se eliminaran para ocultar su existencia” afirma el investigador en un borrador de sus conclusiones publicado este martes.
Bloom sostiene que las 13 secuencias parciales que ha conseguido reconstruir presentan mutaciones que sugieren que el virus ya circulaba en Wuhan antes del brote de diciembre de 2019 en el mercado de Huanan. Su investigación controvertida y pendiente de revisión por otros científicos destaca tres mutaciones presentes en los coronavirus del mercado pero ausentes en las secuencias rescatadas ahora y en los virus de murciélago emparentados con el SARS-CoV-2. Algunos especialistas creen que esta nueva información es clave. El genetista Rasmus Nielsen de la Universidad de California en Berkeley (EE UU) ha afirmado en sus redes sociales que “estos son los datos más importantes sobre el origen de la covid en más de un año”.
Otros expertos como el genetista Fernando González Candelas son mucho más escépticos. “Hace mucho ruido con poca paja real todo para concluir que la pandemia no empezó en el mercado de Wuhan lo que ya se sabía y que el virus circulaba antes de lo que se ha dicho como ocurre siempre en una nueva epidemia” opina González Candelas catedrático de la Universidad de Valencia. “Lo de borrar secuencias de una base de datos no es lo habitual pero habrá que ver por qué se ha hecho. Puestos a especular es una buena arma para cualquier teoría conspirativa” añade.
Los archivos fueron suprimidos de la base de datos SRA perteneciente a los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud de EE UU. El organismo una agencia gubernamental ha explicado este miércoles en un comunicado que borró las secuencias en junio de 2020 a petición de un investigador chino que tenía los derechos sobre ellas. El científico indicó que la información se había actualizado que la quería enviar a otra base de datos y que deseaba eliminar la primera versión para evitar confusiones.
Las indagaciones de Bloom apuntan a que las muestras de aquellos pacientes de covid fueron recogidas por el farmacéutico chino Aisi Fu en el Hospital Renmin de la Universidad de Wuhan. Aisi Fu y sus colegas no escondieron entonces el material todo lo contrario. Usaron la información para desarrollar un test de detección del coronavirus y publicaron un borrador de sus resultados el 6 de marzo de 2020. Y hace justo un año publicaron sus conclusiones definitivas en la revista especializada Small un estudio con información parcial de las secuencias que con un formato inusual y en una revista minoritaria pasó desapercibido. Tanto Bloom como la revista Science han intentado obtener la versión de los investigadores chinos sin éxito. El bioquímico estadounidense no ha encontrado las secuencias borradas en ninguna otra base de datos.
Jesse Bloom pertenece al grupo de 18 científicos de primera fila que pidió el 13 de mayo “una auténtica investigación” sobre el origen de la pandemia. A juicio de estos expertos “siguen siendo posibles tanto la teoría de un escape accidental de un laboratorio como la de un salto natural desde los animales”. El Instituto de Virología de Wuhan en cuyos laboratorios se trabajaba con coronavirus antes de la pandemia está a 14 kilómetros del mercado de Huanan.
Los 18 científicos en una carta publicada en la revista Science fueron muy críticos con el informe de la misión conjunta de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y China cuyos autores aseguraron en marzo de 2021 que la hipótesis de una fuga de un laboratorio era “extremadamente improbable” mientras que el salto natural desde un animal era “probable o muy probable”.
El propio informe de la OMS detalla 168 casos de covid en Wuhan en diciembre de 2019 47 de ellos asociados al mercado de Huanan. Otros enfermos 38 habían estado en otros establecimientos similares pero no habían visitado el de Huanan. El virólogo Robert Garry experto en virus emergentes de la Universidad Tulane (EE UU) ha detectado dos linajes distintos de coronavirus en esos primeros casos vinculados con mercados de fauna salvaje.

24/06/2021 

una pesquisa en solitario de un prestigioso científico estadounidense ha provocado un pequeño terremoto en la investigación del origen de la pandemia el bioquímico jesse bloom —del centro de investigación fred hutchinson en seattle— se percató de que algunas secuencias genómicas de los primeros casos de covid en la ciudad china de wuhan habían desaparecido de una base de datos internacional en un trabajo detectivesco deduciendo el nombre de los archivos bloom logró recuperar la información borrada gracias a que también se había subido a la plataforma google cloud un espacio virtual de almacenamiento “parece probable que las secuencias se eliminaran para ocultar su existencia” afirma el investigador en un borrador de sus conclusiones publicado este martes
bloom sostiene que las 13 secuencias parciales que ha conseguido reconstruir presentan mutaciones que sugieren que el virus ya circulaba en wuhan antes del brote de diciembre de 2019 en el mercado de huanan su investigación controvertida y pendiente de revisión por otros científicos destaca tres mutaciones presentes en los coronavirus del mercado pero ausentes en las secuencias rescatadas ahora y en los virus de murciélago emparentados con el sars-cov-2 algunos especialistas creen que esta nueva información es clave el genetista rasmus nielsen de la universidad de california en berkeley (ee uu) ha afirmado en sus redes sociales que “estos son los datos más importantes sobre el origen de la covid en más de un año”
otros expertos como el genetista fernando gonzález candelas son mucho más escépticos “hace mucho ruido con poca paja real todo para concluir que la pandemia no empezó en el mercado de wuhan lo que ya se sabía y que el virus circulaba antes de lo que se ha dicho como ocurre siempre en una nueva epidemia” opina gonzález candelas catedrático de la universidad de valencia “lo de borrar secuencias de una base de datos no es lo habitual pero habrá que ver por qué se ha hecho puestos a especular es una buena arma para cualquier teoría conspirativa” añade
los archivos fueron suprimidos de la base de datos sra perteneciente a los institutos nacionales de la salud de ee uu el organismo una agencia gubernamental ha explicado este miércoles en un comunicado que borró las secuencias en junio de 2020 a petición de un investigador chino que tenía los derechos sobre ellas el científico indicó que la información se había actualizado que la quería enviar a otra base de datos y que deseaba eliminar la primera versión para evitar confusiones
las indagaciones de bloom apuntan a que las muestras de aquellos pacientes de covid fueron recogidas por el farmacéutico chino aisi fu en el hospital renmin de la universidad de wuhan aisi fu y sus colegas no escondieron entonces el material todo lo contrario usaron la información para desarrollar un test de detección del coronavirus y publicaron un borrador de sus resultados el 6 de marzo de 2020 y hace justo un año publicaron sus conclusiones definitivas en la revista especializada small un estudio con información parcial de las secuencias que con un formato inusual y en una revista minoritaria pasó desapercibido tanto bloom como la revista science han intentado obtener la versión de los investigadores chinos sin éxito el bioquímico estadounidense no ha encontrado las secuencias borradas en ninguna otra base de datos
jesse bloom pertenece al grupo de 18 científicos de primera fila que pidió el 13 de mayo “una auténtica investigación” sobre el origen de la pandemia a juicio de estos expertos “siguen siendo posibles tanto la teoría de un escape accidental de un laboratorio como la de un salto natural desde los animales” el instituto de virología de wuhan en cuyos laboratorios se trabajaba con coronavirus antes de la pandemia está a 14 kilómetros del mercado de huanan
los 18 científicos en una carta publicada en la revista science fueron muy críticos con el informe de la misión conjunta de la organización mundial de la salud (oms) y china cuyos autores aseguraron en marzo de 2021 que la hipótesis de una fuga de un laboratorio era “extremadamente improbable” mientras que el salto natural desde un animal era “probable o muy probable”
el propio informe de la oms detalla 168 casos de covid en wuhan en diciembre de 2019 47 de ellos asociados al mercado de huanan otros enfermos 38 habían estado en otros establecimientos similares pero no habían visitado el de huanan el virólogo robert garry experto en virus emergentes de la universidad tulane (ee uu) ha detectado dos linajes distintos de coronavirus en esos primeros casos vinculados con mercados de fauna salvaje su hipótesis es que un progenitor del virus en los murciélagos saltó a otra especie algunos animales infectados fueron capturados y los ejemplares afectados —ya con diferentes (truncated)",29,0.0,0.4023568512010393

EN ADELANTE NADIE VOLVERÁ A ENFERMAR Y/O MORIR DE GRIPE=INFLUENZA SINO ÚNICAMENTE DEL “nuevo y supermortal Covid-19” ¡Que es tan solo uno de los millones de coronavirus de la gripe que siempre han existido es decir el Covid-19 es la misma gripe o influenza de siempre que siempre ha mutado o cambiado de manera constante en nuevas cepas que siempre ha matado gente de todas las edades y de la cual muchos se reinfectan varias veces al año...

QUIENES PERTENECEN A LA VERDAD DEBEN SABER QUE UNO DE LOS OBJETIVOS DEL TAPABOCAS TÓXICO Y DE LAS VACUNAS PRO-ABORTO COVID-19 (con RNA mensajero) ES DEBILITAR Y DESACTIVAR EL SISTEMA INMUNOLÓGICO QUE PROTEGE TU ORGANISMO PARA QUE CUALQUIERA DE LOS MILLONES DE CORONAVIRUS Y/O BACTERIAS CON LOS QUE SIEMPRE HEMOS COEXISTIDO E INTERACTUADO PUEDA MATARNOS A NOMBRE DEL RÓTULO: “COVID-19”…

Aunque de nada sirva (((pues la necedad e indiferencia de las mayorías es desconcertante))) quienes conocen La Verdad deben continuar dándola a conocer pues de lo contrario se convierten en cómplices del padre de la mentira lucifer-satanás. La falsa pandemia es parte de la agenda luciferina que está en marcha desde siglos atrás y cuyo objetivo fundamental es la aniquilación moral espiritual y física de la humanidad. Esta agenda es promovida por la élite judeo-masónica-luciferina que gobierna el mundo y que actúa a través de su numerosa red de esbirros en cada país.

Debes saber que la humanidad NO se encuentra ante un virus nuevo pues Covid-19 es el nombre dado a uno de los millones de coronavirus con los cuales SIEMPRE hemos coexistido e interactuado y de los cuales solo unos pocos han recibido un nombre. En condiciones normales estos coronavirus NO representan mayor riesgo para los seres humanos con respuesta inmunológica normal; pero si se generan las condiciones adecuadas cualquier coronavirus o bacteria de los millones que existen pueden enfermarte gravemente y causarte la muerte. Debemos entender que todos somos portadores asintomáticos de coronavirus gracias a nuestro sistema inmunológico que los debilita atenúa y controla del mismo modo que lo hace con los millones de bacterias que tenemos en nuestro cuerpo. (La prueba PCR NO identifica específicamente ningún virus sino que detecta presencia viral en general. Lo que han hecho es poner el nombre de Covid-19 a todos los coronavirus existentes de ahí que la mayoría de las pruebas arrojen positivos sin síntomas lo que NO te convierte en un contagiado pues lo normal es que todos convivamos con coronavirus controlados por nuestros sistemas inmunológicos es decir con una carga viral normal)

De modo que la élite satánica que controla el mundo y que tiene por esbirros a todos los gobiernos y sus instituciones de salud lo que está haciendo es generar las condiciones propicias para que cualquier coronavirus incluidos los que tu sistema inmune tiene atenuados y bajo control en tu propio cuerpo se multiplique descontroladamente (elevar la carga viral) provocando síntomas y llevándote a la muerte.

Pero ¿Cómo generan las condiciones propicias para que cualquier coronavirus existente se vuelva mortal? Pues debilitando y desactivando tu sistema inmunológico de varios modos: Primero con las múltiples fuentes de contaminación los insalubres hábitos alimenticios promovidos en la TV el estilo de vida estresante y las vacunas contaminadas que han promovido permanentemente. Segundo con los cultivos transgénicos que mediante la manipulación genética han sido despojados de los nutrientes y minerales necesarios para el fortalecimiento y correcto funcionamiento del sistema inmunológico y del organismo en general. Tercero con la permanente campaña mediática promoviendo la desinfección compulsiva para que nuestro sistema inmunológico NO se fortalezca enfrentando permanentemente virus bacterias y demás gérmenes. Cuarto con el uso permanente y obligatorio de máscaras faciales (bozales tóxicos o pañales faciales) que debilitan tu sistema inmunológico debido a la disminución de oxígeno respirado y a la intoxicación acumulativa por dióxido de carbono.

La falsa pandemia es parte de la agenda luciferina que está en marcha desde siglos atrás y cuyo objetivo fundamental es la aniquilación moral espiritual y física de la humanidad. Esta agenda es promovida por la élite judeo-masónica-luciferina que gobierna el mundo y que actúa a través de su numerosa red de esbirros en cada país.\n\nDebes saber que la humanidad NO se encuentra ante un virus nuevo pues Covid-19 es el nombre dado a uno de los millones de coronavirus con los cuales SIEMPRE hemos coexistido e interactuado y de los cuales solo unos pocos han recibido un nombre. En condiciones normales estos coronavirus NO representan mayor riesgo para los seres humanos con respuesta inmunológica normal; pero si se generan las condiciones adecuadas cualquier coronavirus o bacteria de los millones que existen pueden enfermarte gravemente y causarte la muerte. Debemos entender que todos somos portadores asintomáticos de coronavirus gracias a nuestro sistema inmunológico que los debilita atenúa y controla del mismo modo que lo hace con los millones de bacterias que tenemos en nuestro cuerpo. (La prueba PCR NO identifica específicamente ningún virus sino que detecta presencia viral en general. Lo que han hecho es poner el nombre de Covid-19 a todos los coronavirus existentes de ahí que la mayoría de las pruebas arrojen positivos sin síntomas lo que NO te convierte en un contagiado pues lo normal es que todos convivamos con coronavirus controlados por nuestros sistemas inmunológicos es decir con una carga viral normal)\n\nDe modo que la élite satánica que controla el mundo y que tiene por esbirros a todos los gobiernos y sus instituciones de salud lo que está haciendo es generar las condiciones propicias para que cualquier coronavirus incluidos los que tu sistema inmune tiene atenuados y bajo control en tu propio cuerpo se multiplique descontroladamente (elevar la carga viral) provocando síntomas y llevándote a la muerte.\n\nPero ¿Cómo generan las condiciones propicias para que cualquier coronavirus existente se vuelva mortal? Pues debilitando y desactivando tu sistema inmunológico de varios modos: Primero con las múltiples fuentes de contaminación los insalubres hábitos alimenticios promovidos en la TV el estilo de vida estresante y las vacunas contaminadas que han promovido permanentemente. Segundo con los cultivos transgénicos que mediante la manipulación genética han sido despojados de los nutrientes y minerales necesarios para el fortalecimiento y correcto funcionamiento del sistema inmunológico y del organismo en general. Tercero con la permanente campaña mediática promoviendo la desinfección compulsiva para que nuestro sistema inmunológico NO se fortalezca enfrentando permanentemente virus bacterias y demás gérmenes. Cuarto con el uso permanente y obligatorio de máscaras faciales (bozales tóxicos o pañales faciales) que debilitan tu sistema inmunológico debido a la disminución de oxígeno respirado y a la intoxicación acumulativa por dióxido de carbono.

I am new to this entire deal but I’ve suffered more than I ever have in my entire life! The pain I’ve experienced was worse than child birth and broken bones combined! 😭💔.. on august 2nd I had unbearable stomach pains.. I kept going back to the er every other day for new symptoms.. I tested positive on the 7th .. I kept getting sicker and sicker I kept going to the ER but because my oxygen was running at 90-92 they kept sending me home 😮‍💨😞 and then the next two days after like my 8th ER visit .. my oxygen was riding at about 80-84.. I have picture and videos for proof .. I was so traumatized from going to the hospital over and over and not being admitted I suffered those to days barely being able to breath day three I woke up to this leg pain I never felt before in my ENTIRE LIFE AND I HAVE NO IDEA what it was .. doing research now im GUESSING it was nerve related but the doctors said it was hypoxia because when the ambulance came on that day my oxygen was at 72% 12 points away from cyanosis 😓 .. I was finally admitted they did a 5 day treatment of Remdesivir on me and I was there about 8 days I was also put on oxygen and currently still am .. I am diagnosed a long hauler I’ve had the pain in my legs that I don’t know what it is I still have pneumonia and it’s September 13th I’ve had it for other a month! I actually lost my taste today????? Is that normal for long haulers? I also for the last week had the worst stomach issues i can eat I’m not nauseous but when I eat it gives my stomach cramps and pain my nose is stuffy I use this prescription nose stuff to clear it out so I can breath with my oxygen in my nose! My body aches im miserably tired and constantly being told by doctors to walk around if I take my oxygen off I go down to 80-95 oxygen I’m currently feeling full blown Covid symptoms and I was at the er last night my blood work is perfect the ct scan showed my pneumonia is still bad in both lungs and prominent.. but nothing wrong with my stomach or vitals even tho my blood pressure was bouncing around!? I have the worst head aches .. I’m having the hardest time because my primary care physician of 8yrs got fire￼d 2 weeks before I was diagnosed with Covid.. It took me so long to find a dr that would accept me and I got an appointment on the 24th .. I’m ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE DISTRAUGHT TRAUMATIZED and I feel completely useless I have two children and a husband and I feel like I’m never going to be the same again because I keep digressing .. it’s made me the most depressed I’ve ever been.. does anyone get so bad they get put on disability for this? I was supposed to start my externship from school because right after I got my certificates for “certified clinical medical assistant” and “certified phlebotomist technician” I got Covid and was unable to start extern .. I’m on LOA till January but by now I would have been making money and I don’t know how me and my husband are going to live off of his check alone .. that’s why I asked about the disability sorry for asking SOOO MUCH .. I’m just .. I have no experience with what’s going on with me .. my health and what the future holds .. I’m in desperate need of some answers my new friends .. I mean it feels like family reading these posts because you all have experienced the terrible things I have and I’m so sorry 😞 to each and every one of you who suffered the way did and am .. this is just the WORST.. thank you taking the time to read this and respond to my questions if you do .. and yes I have been retest this week for Covid because of my digression this week it’s been over the top .. I’m actually seeing double typing to you lovely people right now .. and I’m sorry I’ll shut up now too .. thank you so so much for you time I appreciate you more than you ever know if you read my long haul story .. thank you .. have a great day every ..

Better than I have in the past year and half or so.. still have the brain fog lightly and the pins and needles come and go but not nearly as often as before.. it’s been pretty rarely. Also haven’t seem to be having the heart palpitations at night as i was before and I’m sleeping better. Maybe with more time to heal from the long haul and the added medications things are starting to get better. Anyways a little update for everyone. Still sending prayers to all who are dealing with their symptoms. 🙏🏼✝️** First off I would like to say that I am happy I stumbled upon this Facebook group as a result of my own research and countless hours of google searches trying to find the cause of my symptoms. Early 2021 was my first round dealing with Covid and the end 2021 I got it again. My first experience with it I had nothing worse that any of my other colds BESIDES the very extensive spine pain. I remember when that symptom set telling my wife it felt like shooting nerve pains. Fast forward to a about a month after I started to heal came the wave of insomnia wrestles legs and crazy night sweats. At first I did not think this was a result of Covid… I had just came off of an SSRI that I had been on for about 12 years and thought it could be withdrawal symptoms and my doctor put me on gabapentin for that. After a bit I came off the gabapentin and the brain fog kicked in along with the what it seemed heat intolerance & the pins and needles (I could hardly stand it .. not to mention the hives I’d get on my wrists) I’ve also had heart palpitations that seems to be worsened at night (still currently living with this). At this point I still didn’t think it had anything to do with Covid. I searched and searched google with my symptoms and I’m sure as y’all know I got some worst case search results and just felt more crazy in my head. Boom here comes my brand new baby daughter born into the world.. and man if having a newborn isnt exhausting enough without Covid symptoms.. we’ll let me tell you.. 28 years old felt like i had already lived my full life physically. This was very mentally straining on me i felt like I couldn’t keep up with the kids as the father i wanted to be and felt like a poor husband being constantly fatigued and exhausted could hardly Get through a day of work. Finally I decided to go to my general dr. To get to the bottom of this. I got blood test run along with allergy test.. no findings.Went back to ask for my lab work.. no findings. Finally i went to a neurologist and had an MRI of my brain and spine. No findings besides my sinuses having issues that I was already aware of. Neurologist put me back on the gabapentin( I’m now on 1200mg a day) and it has definitely helped the pins and needles but have not erased them by any means. At this point I start doing my own research and find info on Covid causing neurological issues. Everyone around seemed to think I was crazy including drs as so I thought at least. Felt very alone. My general dr pointed to anxiety and dismissed my concerns. Went back to my neurologist a few weeks ago and mentioned Covid long haul and a clinic at the UW hospital in Washington state. He recommended checking it out and even wrote me a referral…and that brings me to today. Today by no means are my symptoms gone  they come and go but i feel decently well…. still deal with a decent amount of brain fog and just a general feeling on not feeling my old self completely but i feel physically a lot better that I have over the past months. Some weeks or days are better than others and can be a rollercoaster of feelings physically and emotionally. Tonight i can rest my head and thank God for another day.. and count my blessings in my life. I am sure I still got a long road and may never get 100% back to my old way of feeling but I will still keep my head up and try to stay positive whatever that may look like on any given day. Thanks for all of your posts on your stories symptoms and experiences. It has truly been a help for me to jump the hurdle of feeling alone and crazy. Much love to everyone and prayers go out to everyone God bless.🙏🏽,['testing' 'long-hauler'],['health' 'covid'],10,5.2857195714338574e-05,2022-10-16 15:10:33.305766,2022-04-14 09:58:21+00:00,11150438|1195182701230587,{'platformId': '669615740453955_1195182701230587' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2022-04-14 09:58:21' 'updated': '2022-07-03 22:25:47' 'type': 'status' 'message': '***PROGRESS UPDATE ON THIS POST*** ** neurologist stepped my gabapentin up to 1200mg a day and I went back on my ssri (5mg lexapro) about a week ago now and I am finally feeling pretty dang good.

44,COVID-19 Long Haulers Support,https://www.facebook.com/groups/373920943948661/permalink/694884561852296,facebook,‼️Super long post but experience as a March 2020 long hauler here. Back before anyone knew what long covid was. Ive been through all of the symptoms. The techycardia tremors nerve pain gi issues headaches migraines brain fog no smell and taste for 23 months (it came and went but never strong) phantom smells faritue. OH THE FATIGUE. You name it Ive been through it. It seems us early 2020 haulers have really gone through it. Id say Im about 85% recovered. I just wanted to give an update of where I am in my journey. I am not a doctor just suggesting what worked for me. ‼️ Medicine especially an SSRI was a last resort at all costs despite all of my symptoms I tried everything naturally first. I completely changed to an anti inflammatory diet cut out alcohol started taking about 15 supplements my lifestyle changed completely. I meditate before bed I journal. I see my therapist every other week. I am the healthiest mentally I have ever been. Im so intune wity my body. I was getting better! In December 2021 I was working with a fitness coach. I was increasing steps to 8-10k per day. Then we had a huge outbreak at work. Everyone was sick and noone wearing masks. I never tested positive but I had so many symptoms. It doesnt matter though even if it was just an upper respiratory it caused a MEGA flare. The nerve pain ramped up so bad I couldnt even cut food to meal prep. I started to lose feeling of hot and cold. It was really scary and the pain was so bad. My entire body has been swollen since January. I cant wear a ring Ive worn for 7 years and I cant even wear earings. The month of February was the WORST month I have had on this journey. It was the first time I lost true faith and thought about ending it. I was a month away from the 2 year mark and I was so sick every day and dealing with the worst pain I have ever experienced. I couldnt go on my phone after work because I had so much pain from typing all day. My hands and feet with burning and shooting feelings. I started having these seizure like tremor attacks. I honestly felt like I couldnt go on. Then I started seeing fluvoxamine floating around. I was so nervous to take an SSRI but at that point I was desperate. I had horrible experiences with the medicine they had already prescribed. I didnt want to deal with the nasty side effects again. But then I kept seeing it pop up more and more. I did tons of research and decided to try it for 1 week. Side note at this point Im pretty much telling my doctor what I want to try. Well we were on video chat and he thought I said fluoxetine (prozac) and when I got to walgeens I was like....no thats not right. And he was so confused why I wanted to try it but I told him how many people were reporting improvement. He was warning me fluvoxamine symptoms would be rough and is very heavy but I insisted I had done my research. I will say he has been wonderful and Im incredibly lucky to have a doctor who listens and believes me. He just doesnt know how to help anymore. I started taking fluvoxamine which lowers inflammation in the brain and I have been feeling AMAZING. The best Ive felt since the summer of 2020; things improved for a couple months and its been a constant battle since. My taste and smell had also been gone since I first got sick. A little over a week after starting the pill I could smell and taste again. I I was having tremor attacks and twitches that have stopped. My recall and memory has been soo much better majority of my days. I take a low dose of 50 and so far its been my miracle. I know Ive seen some starting at 100mg theres a lot of really harsh side effects for the first 2 weeks. I know Ive seen some cit the 50 in half and do 25 the first week. But it gets better!! Also I would talk to your doctor about cbd thc (if its legal) and/or xanax and zofran for when you start taking it. I had REALLY bad anxiety and panic attacks every night for the first like 10 days. I use cbd and delta 8 because its more natural and I hate xanax. CBD after work did help. I was also super nauseas with diarrhea for about 2 weeks straight and now its been on and off Ive been taking it for a little over month. 50mg at bedtime. But Ive been having WAY more good days than bad. I just had to push through the first 2 weeks. I was noticing improvements in 3 days by week 2 I was feeling amazing not amazing by normal standards but AMAZING by LC standards. Fluxvoxamine was my last resort. I was so adament I didnt want to start an SSRI 2 years ago giving patients SSRIS after a virus would have been INSANE!! Doctors would have been fired. Imagine walking into work saying your doctor prescribed you an SSRI after your 3 day flu.... but now its starting to become normalized. We have 0 idea what effects these medicines will have on our brains in the future. I know we cant think in advance and need to heal now but Ive literally altered my brain chemistry forever taking this (truncated),['testing' 'treatments' 'long-hauler' 'variants'],['health' 'covid'],625,0.0076582813591305,2022-10-16 15:13:17.287372,2022-04-01 13:48:37+00:00,13487526|694884561852296,"{'platformId': '373920943948661_694884561852296' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2022-04-01 13:48:37' 'updated': '2022-07-07 11:18:33' 'type': 'photo' 'message': ""‼️Super long post but experience as a March 2020 long hauler here.

i've been through all of the symptoms the techycardia tremors nerve pain gi issues headaches migraines brain fog no smell and taste for 23 months (it came and went but never strong) phantom smells faritue oh the fatigue you name it i've been through it it seems us early 2020 haulers have really gone through it i'd say i'm about 85% recovered i just wanted to give an update of where i am in my journey i am not a doctor just suggesting what worked for me ‼️ medicine especially an ssri was a last resort at all costs despite all of my symptoms i tried everything naturally first i completely changed to an anti inflammatory diet cut out alcohol started taking about 15 supplements my lifestyle changed completely i meditate before bed i journal i see my therapist every other week i am the healthiest mentally i have ever been i'm so intune wity my body i was getting better in december 2021 i was working with a fitness coach i was increasing steps to 8-10k per day then we had a huge outbreak at work everyone was sick and noone wearing masks i never tested positive but i had so many symptoms it doesn't matter though even if it was just an upper respiratory it caused a mega flare the nerve pain ramped up so bad i couldnt even cut food to meal prep i started to lose feeling of hot and cold it was really scary and the pain was so bad my entire body has been swollen since january i can't wear a ring i've worn for 7 years and i can't even wear earings the month of february was the worst month i have had on this journey it was the first time i lost true faith and thought about ending it i was a month away from the 2 year mark and i was so sick every day and dealing with the worst pain i have ever experienced i couldnt go on my phone after work because i had so much pain from typing all day my hands and feet with burning and shooting feelings i started having these seizure like tremor attacks i honestly felt like i couldnt go on then i started seeing fluvoxamine floating around i was so nervous to take an ssri but at that point i was desperate i had horrible experiences with the medicine they had already prescribed i didn't want to deal with the nasty side effects again but then i kept seeing it pop up more and more i did tons of research and decided to try it for 1 week side note at this point i'm pretty much telling my doctor what i want to try well we were on video chat and he thought i said fluoxetine (prozac) and when i got to walgeens i was likeno thats not right and he was so confused why i wanted to try it but i told him how many people were reporting improvement he was warning me fluvoxamine symptoms would be rough and is very heavy but i insisted i had done my research i will say he has been wonderful and i'm incredibly lucky to have a doctor who listens and believes me he just doesn't know how to help anymore i started taking fluvoxamine which lowers inflammation in the brain and i have been feeling amazing the best i've felt since the summer of 2020; things improved for a couple months and its been a constant battle since my taste and smell had also been gone since i first got sick a little over a week after starting the pill i could smell and taste again i i was having tremor attacks and twitches that have stopped my recall and memory has been soo much better majority of my days i take a low dose of 50 and so far its been my miracle i know i've seen some starting at 100mg there's a lot of really harsh side effects for the first 2 weeks i know i've seen some cit the 50 in half and do 25 the first week but it gets better also i would talk to your doctor about cbd thc (if its legal) and/or xanax and zofran for when you start taking it i had really bad anxiety and panic attacks every night for the first like 10 days i use cbd and delta 8 because its more natural and i hate xanax cbd after work did help i was also super nauseas with diarrhea for about 2 weeks straight and now its been on and off i've been taking it for a little over month 50mg at bedtime but i've been having way more good days than bad i just had to push through the first 2 weeks i was noticing improvements in 3 days by week 2 i was feeling amazing not amazing by normal standards but amazing by lc standards fluxvoxamine was my last resort i was so adament i didn't want to start an ssri 2 years ago giving patients ssri's after a virus would have been insane doctors would have been fired imagine walking into work saying your doctor prescribed you an ssri after your 3 day flu but now it's starting to become normalized we have 0 idea what effects these medicines will have on our brains in the future i know we can't think in advance and need to heal now but i've literally altered my brain chemistry forever taking this

Does anyone know what sort of resources the CDC provids to doctors? Far too many doctors dont seem to know about even the known post Covid 19 complications let alone to be up to date on the more rare ones. I got Covid back in September in spite of being fully vacinated and am still having complications. Even though I had pneumonia when I was diagnosed I managed to stay out of the hospital initially. Weeks later however I continued to feel short of breath and could not do simple tasks like load the dishwasher without having to sit down after 15 minutes or so. My blood pressure has been low for my entire life but suddenly it was so high that I required medication. My then doctor had no idea this was a frequent complication of Covid and thought it either coincidental or stress induced. (He thought the fatigue breathing issues and heart palpitations were also due to stress.) When I broke out in a chicken pox like rash five weeks after testing positive he did say that was a possibly Covid 19 related symptom but when it was accompanied by my face turning bright red and feeling hot to the touch and both eyes swelling shut a few days later he continued to insist that I needed psychiatric treatment for stress. I have no problem with trying whatever works. Being out of work for over a month and being incapacitated and not sleeping for over a month because of an insane level of itching were certainly stressful so I agreed to sign up to attend a two week on line stress management class through zoom but by the time the class started the rash on my sternum had caused swelling that moved under my right breast and under my right arm and it [the pain in that area] ]was so sever that I could not sit up for the duration of the class and could not do the deep breathing exercises. I kept trying though hoping for some relief. The pain kept increasing until I could not bend over to pick something up off the floor. I could not roll over in bed without assistance nor could I get out of bed without my husband pulling me into a sitting position. I kept running low grade fevers between 99 and 100 but my oxygen stayed within the safe range. Meanwhile my adult daughter had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance for an unrelated issue that rendered her unconcious and while I was filling out paper work for her  the ER staff kept urging me to be seen. I explained that my HMO wasnt affiliated with their hospital and said I would consider their advise to go to my HMOs ER as soon as my daughter was squared away. However the doctor attending to my daughter later insisted that I be admitted to the ER right then. After x-rays and other diagnostics I was sent to my HMOs hospital and admitted. They did even more tests eventually misdiagnosing me with pluesasy and sending me home. I continued trying to take the on line course but had to turn off the video so that I could lie down while participating. The pain and swelling in my chest and under arm moved around to my back and my left arm swelled so much it became hard to the touch and so painful that even a sleeve brushing up against it was excruciating. A few days later I fell asleep during the class and woke up running a fever of 104 and being too weak to stand. My husband drove me to the local ER where they determined that I had a sever case of cellulitis. I was admitted there and given intravenous antibiotics for a few days before being sent home with a few more weeks worth of antibiotics to get rid of the by then systemic infection. At this point I switched Doctors after realizing my former Doctor had almost killed me by assuming my symptoms were all in my head. It wasnt until I was in the hospital the second time that anyone told me that cellulitis is a rare but definitely possible complication of Covid 19 and that it occurs in roughly one percent of people who have had the rashes. After this experience I am certain that people could be dying because of doctors who are ignorant about all but the most basic complications of this disease. I am grateful for groups like this one that bring awareness but am wondering why on earth doctors are seemingly being given a pass on getting up to speed on complications that are not immediate but are life threatening. And I also want to warn anyone who has had a post Covid 19 rash to watch out if they experience swelling and pain after it. Cellulitis has blinded a number of post Covid patients and killed a number in Brazil but Id never heard of it before being diagnosed. I also want to urge people to not let their doctors minimize or make them feel crazy. Im hardly a hypochondriac. I had several weeks of PTO saved up from the previous year when the pandemic first hit. Over decades of work I rarely take a sick day (the last time was several years ago when I had H1N1 and I was only out three days).

They were checking her every night when she came to work for a fever and symptoms so I didn’t wear my mask while driving her. Unfortunately she was asymptomatic. I came down with it. It started with immediate high fever I went to urgent care they told me to go to the hospital because I was already coughing up yellow stuff. I went home crying thinking I would die if I went to the hospital I called my primary he told me to stay home until I felt unsafe he told me I had oxygen here and breathing treatments he called me and steroids and an anabiotic for information. I was petrified I was on the couch for 18 days could not get up not even to take a bath. I gave it to my husband who had very mild symptoms. I lost my taste and smell he did not.

I would like to share my progress with all of you :-) . Covid pneumonia longhauler since January 2020 of course no hospitalization for me because there was no testing then ! As many of you already know the flare ups come and go the symptoms are always like a gift that creates new symptoms that nobody wants and the repeated cycle of starting symptoms of Covid are like a nightmare to say the least giving us PTSD. Lost a total of 17 family members and friends since March 2020 through September 2021 lost 3 very dear people to my heart in addition to cancer 😢💔😪💔😢💔😪! Started mental therapy in March 2020 realized I needed to advocate and fight for myself ! Had a tough time breathing until May /June and had all sorts if x-rays MRIs as well as tachycardia for the long haul ! Was able to walk again babysteps at first then longer walks. Then came the stupid SOB again. In October of 2020 was diagnosed with a glass opacity left lung as I made an appointment to see a Pulmonologist whom congratulated me on surviving Covid :-( . All the while while symptoms kept coming and going . Fast forward to January symptoms of excruciating back pain started appearing pain doctor did a physical and diagnosed me with all sorts of issues  got an Ct-scan  MRI nothing showed about my back but had a cyst on my adrenal gland one in each kidney and two in my liver 😳. Was giving all these meds that did not help one bit except giving me a buzz that I hated then was given Narproxen it relieved some of the pain level 13  I was exsperiencing except cant take it all the time due to my heart issues. ! In March I took matters into my own hands kept my doctors on top of what I was doing. They may have not always agreed but I am pretty strong minded and was done being a guinea pig ;-) . Started an anti-inflammatory diet  started CBD gummies without THC and within 2 weeks any pain caused by inflammation was gone :-D . I wasnt able to retain any information as far as reading etc. for the longest time either but nothing was going to stop me at this point ! The depression diminished as did the anxiety the PTSD never did though ! By July I was horrified and scared and fighting getting the vaccine yet I was at the right state of mind and did go in late July 2021 ! Got my first dose sore arm and for about 4 days had asthma attacks ! Then something weird happened again were talking Covid remember? My right side under my rib cage started hurting and I felt like someone placed a rock below it  at first I thought I had appendicitis so my doctor wanted to see me right away ! Had an abdominal ultrasound done ended up with a swollen liver and fatty liver disease 😢. So at that point I started drinking 🍋 water no sugar and within a week my swelling went down :-) . Got my second vaccine in August and once again arm hurt asthma kicked in but was only for a few days again. It is now October started 2 classes at the University in September 1 credit each only  one which is my live saver called mindfulness very effective to say the least ;-) .

The president will deliver his speech after polling showed his support for his handling the pandemic has fallen 12 points since April.

A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows 52 percent of Americans now support Biden’s handling the pandemic down from 64 percent in April.

Biden continues to struggle as the delta variant of the coronavirus spreads across the country.

In July the president surrendered to federal health officials who asked for more mask mandates in response to the resurgent spread of the virus — even for those Americans who got vaccinated.

Biden blamed the resurgence of the virus on the unvaccinated population while Dr. Anthony Fauci is keeping his focus on the need for masks for all – at all times.

“We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated and they’re sowing enormous confusion” Biden said in July adding “If those other 100 million got vaccinated we’d be in a very different world.”

The president pressed businesses to require vaccines for their employees to drive up vaccination rates and announced his own requirement for federal employees to get vaccinated or submit to onerous testing and social distancing protocols.

Biden has also struggled to push forward on plans to get Americans to take vaccine booster shots after studies showed reduced effectiveness of their ability to fight off the delta variant.

Two Food and Drug Administration officials resigned in protest of the differences in strategy despite Biden’s repeated insistence he would “follow the science” on vaccination issues.",['testing' 'vaccines' 'booster' 'variants'],['institutional' 'media'],27184,0.0194942845259096,2022-10-30 19:13:06.403367,2021-09-07 18:40:42+00:00,1509241|2657678961917478104,{'platformId': '2657678961917478104_3452252777' 'platform': 'Instagram' 'date': '2021-09-07 18:40:42' 'updated': '2022-07-04 08:41:58' 'type': 'photo' 'description': '👎👎👎President Joe Biden and his team are planning another coronavirus speech on Thursday to detail a “six-pronged strategy” to fight the ongoing pandemic the White House announced Tuesday.\n\nThe president will deliver his speech after polling showed his support for his handling the pandemic has fallen 12 points since April.\n\nA recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows 52 percent of Americans now support Biden’s handling the pandemic down from 64 percent in April.\n\nBiden continues to struggle as the delta variant of the coronavirus spreads across the country.\n\nIn July the president surrendered to federal health officials who asked for more mask mandates in response to the resurgent spread of the virus — even for those Americans who got vaccinated.\n\nBiden blamed the resurgence of the virus on the unvaccinated population while Dr. Anthony Fauci is keeping his focus on the need for masks for all – at all times.\n\n“We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated and they’re sowing enormous confusion” Biden said in July adding “If those other 100 million got vaccinated we’d be in a very different world.”\n\nThe president pressed businesses to require vaccines for their employees to drive up vaccination rates and announced his own requirement for federal employees to get vaccinated or submit to onerous testing and social distancing protocols.\n\nBiden has also struggled to push forward on plans to get Americans to take vaccine booster shots after studies showed reduced effectiveness of their ability to fight off the delta variant.\n\nTwo Food and Drug Administration officials resigned in protest of the differences in strategy despite Biden’s repeated insistence he would “follow the science” on vaccination issues.'

Yeah well like everything else that was a lie as well. 🔴 President Joe Biden plans to meet with his coronavirus team on Tuesday as cases of the virus spike to record highs in the United States

A record 1017376 people in the United States were diagnosed with the virus on Monday according to case trackers.

The vast majority of the daily cases per capita reported on Monday come from New York followed by the northeastern region of the country followed by the south and the midwest.

In Washington DC reports of new infections are up about 800 percent over the last two weeks according to the New York Times. In New York City new cases have increased 600 percent.

The president continues struggling to address his failure to “shut down the virus” as he vowed to do in 2020.

The president and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with the administration’s coronavirus team led by Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday afternoon.

Biden faces increasing questions about his failure to deliver monoclonal antibody treatments to states as the case of the virus surge to record highs.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized the Biden administration for controlling the supply of monoclonal antibody treatments and pausing or slowing distribution to states.

“We’re in a situation where we’ve now asked for 40000 more every week.

“I’m confident we are on the right track” Biden said to reporters at the White House.

The president pulled his mask down to his chin so that reporters could see him speak but ultimately admitted it “looked stupid” and removed his mask entirely.

Biden said he was concerned about the pandemic “worldwide” but said he was pleased with the amount of federal help to states who were struggling with the virus.

More than 145900 people were in U.S. hospitals with coronavirus as of Tuesday according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services beating the previous pandemic peak set in January 2021.

Cases of the virus have exploded as John Hopkins University reports more than 700000 cases daily roughly three times it was during the winter in 2021.

The president spoke to reporters about the battle with the virus as he left Washington DC to deliver a speech condemning election security laws in Georgia.

In December Biden warned of “a winter of severe illness and death” but failed to meet increased demands for more testing monoclonal antibody treatments and newly developed anti-viral drugs approved to treat the virus. The emergence of the omicron variant caught Biden off-guard over the Thanksgiving holiday as it now represents 98.3 percent of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. last week.

The White House continues to struggle with messaging on the virus as Biden’s former medical advisers penned a series of opinion articles criticizing his approach.

The group led by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel called for the administration to move away from “a perpetual state of emergency” and realize the “new normal” of living with the virus and reducing its risks to the vulnerable.

The White House ignored their advice repeatedly urging Americans to get triple-vaccinated to help reduce the severity of coronavirus symptoms.",['testing' 'vaccines' 'treatments' 'variants' 'georgia'],['institutional' 'media'],16050,0.0107890238319789,2022-10-30 19:44:10.403595,2022-01-11 18:31:58+00:00,1509241|2748996305817972811,"{'platformId': '2748996305817972811_3452252777' 'platform': 'Instagram' 'date': '2022-01-11 18:31:58' 'updated': '2022-07-04 08:41:59' 'type': 'photo' 'description': '⬛️ Deadly Incompetence ⬛️ President Joe Biden defended his administration’s handling of the coronavirus even as the United States reached a record number of cases and hospitalizations.\n\n“I’m confident we are on the right track” Biden said to reporters at the White House.\n\nThe president pulled his mask down to his chin so that reporters could see him speak but ultimately admitted it “looked stupid” and removed his mask entirely.\n\nBiden said he was concerned about the pandemic “worldwide” but said he was pleased with the amount of federal help to states who were struggling with the virus.\n\nMore than 145900 people were in U.S. hospitals with coronavirus as of Tuesday according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services beating the previous pandemic peak set in January 2021.\n\nCases of the virus have exploded as John Hopkins University reports more than 700000 cases daily roughly three times it was during the winter in 2021.\n\nThe president spoke to reporters about the battle with the virus as he left Washington DC to deliver a speech condemning election security laws in Georgia.\n\nIn December Biden warned of “a winter of severe illness and death” but failed to meet increased demands for more testing monoclonal antibody treatments and newly developed anti-viral drugs approved to treat the virus.

We dont need to cancel all our plans and isolate ourselves; there are still some ways we can enjoy the company of loved ones while remaining safe.

Aside from the obvious things weve been shouting from the rooftops (get vaccinated and boosted when eligible wear your mask in public etc.) there are a few other precautions you can take.

If you plan to do any traveling by plane car train etc. make sure you are diligently wearing your mask and doing your best to maintain physical distance from others when in public. Remember the quality of the mask will impact the protection afforded. K/N95s and multi-layer surgical masks are better than most cloth masks. (Hold your mask up to the light. The tighter the weave the less light you’ll see and the more protected youll be; of course make sure you can still breathe through it though!)

Remember its a numbers game. The more people you are exposed to the higher your risk of exposure. Its a very good idea to keep gatherings small and limited to friends and family members who you know have been taking COVID-19 precautions.

Avoid the holiday rush! Rather than dealing with busy crowds of people rethink gifting to minimize trips to the store (e.g. gift cards experiences homemade crafts etc). Or avoid the big box stores and support a local small business thats less congested!

Finally depending on where you live move holiday gatherings outdoors if weather permits. Keep windows open whenever possible to increase ventilation.

We are proponents of utilizing rapid testing as another layer of protection. Consider recommending rapid tests before holiday gatherings. These should be performed within hours of the gathering if not immediately upon arrival.

We wish you health and happiness this holiday season! Remember we are all in this together!

Give T.H.A.N.K.S. this year:
T - Take steps early. Preventing the spread of COVID during the holidays is more than just wearing a mask watching your distance from others and washing your hands. It’s about caring for those you love by taking steps to keep everyone safe. The best way to do that is to by getting the #COVID19Vaccine.
H - Have family plans. Having a family plan to prevent catching or spreading the disease can keep unneeded worry out of holiday gatherings. If you have family members who cannot receive the vaccine plan for them to attend your gathering virtually so they aren’t excluded.  Full vaccination for the highest level of protection is two weeks after the second dose or if you had your vaccine more than eight months ago two weeks after your booster shot. 
A – Awareness. Stay aware of the latest COVID-19 news and information by checking updates from credible sources such as the CDC and local public health departments.
N - New treatments are here. Many new medical advances have been approved that help treat COVID and limit the severity of the disease. That is reason to be thankful.
K - Keep calm and be kind. Please be considerate and try to remain calm when faced with anxieties about the pandemic. Understand that some family members may not participate in large gatherings. Discuss steps that will make them feel safer such as mask-wearing and other methods to reduce the spread of COVID. Talk with family and friends to acknowledge stress and anxiety.

However particularly with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant we still recommended caution including taking rapid antigen tests JUST before your holiday gatherings (and of course if you tested positive to not attend those).

So if you did have a holiday gathering and everyone rapid tested negative is there anything you should do now? That answer is YES.

First absolutely get tested in the coming days. While previous variants had incubation periods of 5-7 days (sometimes as long as 14 days) the Omicron variant appears to have a much shorter incubation period. This means you can become contagious much faster than before and can also mean a rapid negative test in the morning might not mean a rapid negative test in the afternoon of the same day.

Test within 2-4 days of your gathering. Even if all the attendees tested negative using rapid tests you should test. If you recall rapid tests provide an instantaneous picture of the time you took the test. It cannot identify infected people who did not have quite enough viral load at that moment in time. The estimated incubation period of Omicron is about 3 days so testing within that window will provide an extra layer of precaution. This is particularly important now when case numbers are rising exponentially and hospitals are already overwhelmed.

In addition you need to take extra precautions around others until those test results come back. If you can quarantine for 7 days do so. If you can’t and you absolutely need to interact with others in public you need to be wearing the best quality masks available; N95 KN95 or KF94s. No exceptions.

If you do test positive or develop symptoms you need to isolate for 10 days.

El artículo que ha tenido gran repercusión en las redes sociales trata principalmente de un número que los periodistas no cuestionaron en ningún momento y que una vez realizada la primera comprobación ha resultado falso: la diferencia entre los pacientes que ingresaron debido infección por coronavirus y los que fueron hospitalizados con un dudoso diagnóstico de coronavirus dice Weichardt. Según el periodista más de una cuarta parte de los pacientes de Covid-19 registrados en hospitales daneses en diciembre tenían un diagnóstico principal diferente. El primer ejercicio de contraste de datos ha dado como resultado un engrosamiento de las cifras pandémicas que sin duda a contribuido a que los ciudadanos se hagan una falsa idea de la situación. «Por supuesto son principalmente las autoridades las que tienen la responsabilidad de informar a la población de manera correcta precisa y honesta» se queja Weichardt. «Las cifras correctas sobre cuántos pacientes se enfermaron y murieron por coronaviurs deberían haberse publicado hace mucho tiempo por razones obvias para que podamos tener una imagen clara del monstruo que duerme debajo de nuestra cama». El periódico se queja de haber recibido de las fuentes gubernamentales «demasiados errores demasiados datos falsos demasiada ignorancia» sobre el desarrollo de la pandemia y explica la incapacidad de los medios de comunicación para comprobar por su cuenta determinados datos administrativos y científicos. Desliza una acusación al gobierno danés de haber tergiversado intencionadamente las dimensiones reales de la pandemia presentándolas mayores de lo que eran en realidad. Las autoridades danesas sin embargo rechazan la acusación. El director del centro de investigación estatal Statens Serum Institut (SSI) Henrik Ullum ha respondido que «el SSI ha revelado fielmente las cifras de pacientes que no tienen un diagnóstico de Covid 19 sino solo una prueba de PCR SARS-CoV-2 positiva». Al comienzo de la pandemia recuerda alrededor del 90% de los pacientes con coronavirus en los hospitales daneses habrían tenido ese diagnóstico. Este otoño el porcentaje rondaba el 80% según un informe publicado a mediados de noviembre. «La imagen cambió mucho con la variante Omicron porque muchas más personas se infectaron e ingresaron sin enfermarse particularmente» dice Ullum «por lo tanto ahora es más relevante diferenciar». El caso es que hay varios investigadores que están de acuerdo con Weichardt en su crítica. «Nos jactamos de tener los mejores datos de salud del mundo y luego ni siquiera podemos medir correctamente uno de los indicadores de covid más importantes» se apena Jes Søgaard profesor de Economía de la Salud en la Universidad de Syddansk en declaraciones al periódico Berlingske. Søgaard también enfatiza que las cifras oficiales son en todo caso el único reflejo disponible de la carga sobre los hospitales y un dato fundamental para valorar la conveniencia de restricciones que podría haber estado impulsando medidas incorrectas. A pesar de un número récord de infecciones y una incidencia nacional de más de 2.000 el número de pacientes en los hospitales de Dinamarca se mantiene actualmente estable o está disminuyendo ligeramente. Debido a que la ola Omicron no ha golpeado al sistema de salud tan gravemente como se temía el domingo entrará en vigor en Dinamarca la reapertura de cines teatros zoológicos salas de conciertos y museos. «Hasta ahora los daneses han confiado en su gobierno y su estrategia contra la pandemia más que en muchos otros países.

The Biden administration did not mandate any of the migrants to be vaccinated before their release. The source informs Breitbart Texas that the figures only include those migrants who were tested by ICE.

The source not authorized to speak to the media says the migrants ranged from infants to the elderly. A Department of Homeland Security document reviewed by Breitbart Texas reports the oldest released migrants were over 85 years old. Nearly 1300 were under the age of ten.

Nearly 12000 of the migrants who tested positive for COVID-19 and were released into the U.S. were between 18 and 40 years of age more than 11800 were male nearly 1300 were under the age of ten and more than 6000 were between 20 and 29 years old.

According to the source the releases occurred in multiple cities across the United States between January 2021 and early October.

The totals do not include the thousands of untested migrants released directly by the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol testing of migrants has been limited to unaccompanied migrant children later turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As reported by Breitbart Texas the Border Patrol relied on non-government organizations to test migrants after their release from detention. Many of those migrants were later released to self-quarantine at hotels within border cities.

The source says the positive tests did not factor in the decision to release. “With the pace of referrals from the Border Patrol we tested made the migrants aware and released them to avoid increasing the detained population” the source revealed. “None of the migrants received the COVID-19 vaccine either voluntary or forced.”",['testing' 'vaccines'],['institutional' 'media'],57478,0.0402593272788146,2022-10-30 19:23:52.736792,2021-10-17 21:46:56+00:00,1509241|2686763724809551756,{'platformId': '2686763724809551756_3452252777' 'platform': 'Instagram' 'date': '2021-10-17 21:46:56' 'updated': '2022-07-04 08:41:59' 'type': 'photo' 'description': '🚨🚨BREAKING🚨🚨 More than 16000 migrants who tested positive for COVID-19 while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody were released into the United States according to an agency law enforcement source.

69,COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS,https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/1030253364411011,facebook,"Florida reports highest daily COVID case count since January with 13256 new cases Published—Friday July 23rd 2021 LANTANA Fla. (CBS12) — Florida continues to lead the nation in new daily COVID cases and this week the state reported more than 13000 new cases in a single day -- the highest daily number since January. ""There is no evidence Ive seen to suggest that the cases will be slowing down considering the transmissibility of the Delta variant"" said Dr. Jason Salemi an epidemiologist from the University of South Florida. The Florida Department of Healths weekly COVID report has not yet been posted but Dr. Salemi predicts based on the steady increase in cases observed over the last few days the state will see 60 to 70000 new COVID cases this week an average of 9000 to 10000 a day. ""The virus just spreads from person to person much more easily"" Dr. Salemi said. ""Even though the vaccine is hugely effective in preventing severe illness fully vaccinated people will continue to test positive and can transmit the virus to others."" According to data the state provided to the CDC Florida added 13256 new COVID cases yesterday. They day before it was 12647 -- the numbers the state used to report before the availability of vaccines. Dr. Salemi said there are still 8 million vaccine-eligible Floridians who are not vaccinated for COVID-19 and 3 million children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible to get the shot. He said even if millions of vaccine-eligible residents got the COVID vaccine tomorrow it would take weeks for immunity to kick in. ""Its not just the vaccination alone that we should be pushing"" Salemi said. ""Right now we need every tool in our tool belt to battle this transmissible variant."" His suggestion is to continue social distancing and wearing a mask indoors and in crowded spaces even for those who are fully-vaccinated. This new wave of infections and the spread of the more-contagious Delta variant may be convincing some people who were on the fence to get their shots. A family of four who did not want to be identified told CBS12 News at a Lantana vaccination site that the Delta variant was one reason they were getting shots Friday. They also wanted their teenage sons to be vaccinated before going back to school in the fall. Thats why 12-year-old Montejo Batista got his first COVID shot Friday. He said it didnt hurt and he thinks more people should consider getting vaccinated. ""We need to keep ourselves safe"" Montejo said. His father Juan Batista said he feels better now that his son is getting more protection from the virus. ""I feel good because now he can go to school and we do not know if the kids have the shot there or not"" Juan said. The current wave of new infections shows no signs of slowing down Dr. Salemi said but he thinks it wont be as widespread as last winters surge. ""I think its not going to be as widespread because we do have a non-trivial proportion that is protected through full vaccination but with the number of people still unprotected it can still do a lot of damage"" he said. Dr. Thomas Unnasch Distinguished Health Professor at USF predicted this is the beginning of the wave fueled by the Delta variant -- not the peak. ""I started getting really concerned with what I was seeing about two weeks ago"" Dr. Unnasch said. ""Hospitalization numbers are also climbing rapidly. The only good thing is the models predict this should drive us to herd immunity quickly. If we do not get any escape mutants this should be the last major wave."" #COVID19FL #COVID19USA #COVID19DISASTER #COVID19SPIKE #COVID19HOTSPOT #COVID19OUTBREAK #OPENEDTOOSOON #COVID19HOSPITALIZATIONS #COVID19SURGE #COVID19WAVE Florida continues to lead the nation in new daily COVID cases and this week the state reported more than 13000 new cases in a single day -- the highest daily number since January.

2021 lantana fla (cbs12) — florida continues to lead the nation in new daily covid cases and this week the state reported more than 13000 new cases in a single day -- the highest daily number since january ""there is no evidence i've seen to suggest that the cases will be slowing down considering the transmissibility of the delta variant"" said dr jason salemi an epidemiologist from the university of south florida the florida department of health's weekly covid report has not yet been posted but dr salemi predicts based on the steady increase in cases observed over the last few days the state will see 60 to 70000 new covid cases this week an average of 9000 to 10000 a day ""the virus just spreads from person to person much more easily"" dr salemi said ""even though the vaccine is hugely effective in preventing severe illness fully vaccinated people will continue to test positive and can transmit the virus to others"" according to data the state provided to the cdc florida added 13256 new covid cases yesterday they day before it was 12647 -- the numbers the state used to report before the availability of vaccines dr salemi said there are still 8 million vaccine-eligible floridians who are not vaccinated for covid-19 and 3 million children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible to get the shot he said even if millions of vaccine-eligible residents got the covid vaccine tomorrow it would take weeks for immunity to kick in ""it's not just the vaccination alone that we should be pushing"" salemi said ""right now we need every tool in our tool belt to battle this transmissible variant"" his suggestion is to continue social distancing and wearing a mask indoors and in crowded spaces even for those who are fully-vaccinated this new wave of infections and the spread of the more-contagious delta variant may be convincing some people who were on the fence to get their shots a family of four who did not want to be identified told cbs12 news at a lantana vaccination site that the delta variant was one reason they were getting shots friday they also wanted their teenage sons to be vaccinated before going back to school in the fall that's why 12-year-old montejo batista got his first covid shot friday he said it didn't hurt and he thinks more people should consider getting vaccinated ""we need to keep ourselves safe"" montejo said his father juan batista said he feels better now that his son is getting more protection from the virus ""i feel good because now he can go to school and we do not know if the kids have the shot there or not"" juan said the current wave of new infections shows no signs of slowing down dr salemi said but he thinks it won't be as widespread as last winter's surge ""i think it's not going to be as widespread because we do have a non-trivial proportion that is protected through full vaccination but with the number of people still unprotected it can still do a lot of damage"" he said dr thomas unnasch distinguished health professor at usf predicted this is the beginning of the wave fueled by the delta variant -- not the peak ""i started getting really concerned with what i was seeing about

This yearly observance hopes to spread information about the impacts of Long COVID around the world. Long COVID support groups and those suffering the illness around the world will unite to host special online events. There will be Twitter Spaces to support those struggling with Long COVID and educate the public about the illness. All over social media we will be posting black and white images of something that we can no longer do because of Long COVID using hashtags: #LongCovidAwarenessDay and #LongCovid. The mission is to bring people together and increase awareness about the disease. In January 2023 first wave Long COVID patient Angela Laffin started a grassroots movement from her couch sending out polls to the patient community on social media to establish an awareness day and to unite with support groups and Long COVID organizations internationally. ""Long COVID is too often left out of the discussion about the negative effects of Covid infections. This day [Long COVID Awareness Day] we act together internationally to show that the impact of Long COVID can no longer be ignored."" -Tove Lundberg chair of the Swedish Covid Association Social media plays a major role in connecting those within the Long COVID community as many people are too unwell to work or leave their home for more than medical appointments. ""It was really no surprise that the month of March was picked for Long COVID Awareness; many that are still suffering in the community were infected in March 2020"" expressed campaign organizer Angela Laffin. ""My hope is that this awareness campaign will make the impacts of Long COVID more visible to those outside our community plus serve as a resource connection hub for both those suffering from Long COVID and also those who may not yet know that they are suffering from this disease."" Long COVID also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a disabling illness with a complex list of over 200 possible symptoms affecting more than 65 million people worldwide. “In March 2022 an estimated 23 million Americans suffered from Long Covid. Today studies suggest that number could be as high as 41 million people battling Long Covid in the United States. Yet there’s no cure or treatment” says filmmaker Joshua Pribanic a Long COVID patient and founder of LCAP (Long Covid Action Project). “On March 15th we act in solidarity calling for an end to the Long COVID crisis through bi-partisan support to find a cure.” In order to help the public take action on #LongCovidAwarenessDay LCAP has created an online letter that when signed can be sent to all levels of the U.S. government. The letter states “Despite incomplete data about vaccines two recent studies from George Washington University and Harvard that looked at infections between 2020-2022 found an average of 40% prevalence of Long COVID – even in these discrete populations that had vaccine mandates. Today we don’t have enough clinics enough funding education nor enough specialists to care for the rising cases of Long COVID. As a large and ever-growing community we feel the United States is not doing enough to meet the needs of this crisis. Therefore we the undersigned demand that your political office explain what steps you are taking in response to the Long COVID crisis by March 16th 2023.” It is unclear how long someone might suffer from Long COVID complications. To date people have lost jobs savings and relationships from the complex chronic conditions Long COVID creates. While some might find a bit of relief with medications supplements or therapies there is no proven treatment for Long COVID. To make matters worse many people living with Long COVID have experienced gaslighting by doctors and loved ones. Unfortunately most people in the general public do not understand how debilitating Long COVID can be. Thats why the March 15th campaign is so important — with education comes understanding. The March 15th campaign will focus on overcoming a myriad of challenges facing the Long COVID community. Our goals include connecting sufferers to peer support resources on where to find social assistance for Long COVID patients Long COVID education programs advocacy for clean air and prevention and urgent funding needed for research and reliable government data.

Long COVID or medically known as post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) first came on our radar in Summer 2020. A landmark study described for the first time that the morbidity of COVID19 goes far beyond initial infection. Since studies have estimated between 10-30% adults have symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks especially for women and/or for those initially hospitalized for COVID19 (here here here). In one meta-analysis 45 studies found 72% of people (mostly hospitalized) reported at least one symptom for 12+ weeks after initial COVID19 infection.

We don’t really know why long COVID happens. There are at least three hypotheses circulating:
1. Some people may harbor the virus in an organ which would be missed by nasal swab. So people continue to have long COVID symptoms
2. Viral pieces stick around in the body causing symptoms for a long time or
3. COVID causes the body to start attacking itself (autoimmune type disease).

Another mystery is that some with initial asymptomatic infection mount long COVID down the road. Something (or more likely a combination of somethings) trigger it.

So what can we do to prevent or at least reduce the burden of long COVID?

***Vaccines***
Before the roll-out we hypothesized vaccines would prevent infection (and thus prevent long COVID). We also hypothesized vaccines would reduce viral load among breakthrough cases. Vaccines minimize the time the virus is in the body and reduces the number of infectious particles. So the less virus the less likelihood of damaging organs and the less likelihood of long COVID.

Now that vaccines have been around for almost 12 months the vaccine’s impact on long COVID is starting to surface. And the results are encouraging. There have been three studies thus far.

***First study***
The first study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Scientists investigated breakthrough cases among healthcare workers in Israel from December 19 2020 to April 28 2021 (before Delta). They wanted to describe the rate and symptoms of breakthrough cases. What did they find?
-Out of 1497 vaccinated (with Pfizer) there were 39 breakthrough cases
-Among the breakthrough cases 19% had symptoms lasting more than 6 weeks (i.e. long COVID). This included loss of smell cough fatigue weakness difficulty breathing and/or muscle pain.
So long COVID19 can occur with breakthrough cases but it’s relatively rare. In this study the rate of long COVID19 among vaccinated was 0.5%.

***Second study***
A second more recent and much larger study was published in the Lancet. It compared the rates of long COVID19 among vaccinated to unvaccinated adults in the UK. The scientists leveraged a massive sample (1240009 adults). They assessed the rate of partially vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after 1st dose but before 2nd dose) and rate of fully vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after dose 2). They also compared the duration of symptoms among breakthrough cases compared to unvaccinated cases. What did they find?
-Of the ~1.2 million adults there were 6030 (0.5%) breakthrough cases among partially vaccinated. There were 2370 (0.2%) cases among fully vaccinated.
-The rate of long COVID19 among partially vaccinated breakthrough cases was the same as the rate of long COVID19 among unvaccinated (9.2% vs 10.7%).
-The rate of long COVID19 among fully vaccinated breakthrough cases was lower than the rate of long COVID19 among unvaccinated (5.2% vs. 11.4%).
So this study was consistent with the first: vaccines don’t 100% prevent long COVID19. But they significantly reduce the chances if fully vaccinated.

***Vaccine after long COVID***
In addition some adults with long COVID that then get vaccinated are finding a nice surprise. A study found that ~30% of people with long COVID19 reported getting better with a vaccine (~20% said symptoms got worse; 50% said symptoms stayed the same). When the scientists compared long COVID19 to unvaccinated there were also promising results:
-14.3% of symptoms worsened in unvaccinated individuals compared to 5.6% of vaccinated patients
-15.4% of symptoms improved in unvaccinated patients compared to 23.2% of vaccinated patients

So vaccines help some alleviate long COVID19 after vaccination. Why? We think the vaccine is helping the immune system in one of two ways:

1. The vaccine clears some of these reservoirs in the organs and essentially eliminates the cause of the problem.
2. The vaccine reprograms the autoreactive cells. Basically the vaccine tells the cells that are attacking to stop.
Is this temporary relief? Maybe. Is it a combination of #1 and #2? Likely. An immunologist (Dr. Akiko Iwasaki) said on NPR: “The fact that not everybodys feeling better after the vaccine indicate that there may be multiple reasons why people are suffering from long COVID.”

The scientists leveraged a massive sample (1240009 adults). They assessed the rate of partially vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after 1st dose but before 2nd dose) and rate of fully vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after dose 2). They also compared the duration of symptoms among breakthrough cases compared to unvaccinated cases. What did they find?
-Of the ~1.2 million adults there were 6030 (0.5%) breakthrough cases among partially vaccinated. There were 2370 (0.2%) cases among fully vaccinated.
-The rate of long COVID19 among partially vaccinated breakthrough cases was the same as the rate of long COVID19 among unvaccinated (9.2% vs 10.7%).
-The rate of long COVID19 among fully vaccinated breakthrough cases was lower than the rate of long COVID19 among unvaccinated (5.2% vs. 11.4%).
So this study was consistent with the first: vaccines don’t 100% prevent long COVID19. But they significantly reduce the chances if fully vaccinated.

***Vaccine after long COVID***
In addition some adults with long COVID that then get vaccinated are finding a nice surprise. A study found that ~30% of people with long COVID19 reported getting better with a vaccine (~20% said symptoms got worse; 50% said symptoms stayed the same). When the scientists compared long COVID19 to unvaccinated there were also promising results:
-14.3% of symptoms worsened in unvaccinated individuals compared to 5.6% of vaccinated patients
-15.4% of symptoms improved in unvaccinated patients compared to 23.2% of vaccinated patients

So vaccines help some alleviate long COVID19 after vaccination. Why? We think the vaccine is helping the immune system in one of two ways:

1. The vaccine clears some of these reservoirs in the organs and essentially eliminates the cause of the problem.
2. The vaccine reprograms the autoreactive cells. Basically the vaccine tells the cells that are attacking to stop.
Is this temporary relief? Maybe. Is it a combination of #1 and #2? Likely. An immunologist (Dr. Akiko Iwasaki) said on NPR: “The fact that not everybodys feeling better after the vaccine indicate that there may be multiple reasons why people are suffering from long COVID.”

A landmark study described for the first time that the morbidity of COVID19 goes far beyond initial infection. Since studies have estimated between 10-30% adults have symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks especially for women and/or for those initially hospitalized for COVID19 (here here here). In one meta-analysis 45 studies found 72% of people (mostly hospitalized) reported at least one symptom for 12+ weeks after initial COVID19 infection.\n\nWe don’t really know why long COVID happens. There are at least three hypotheses circulating:\n1. Some people may harbor the virus in an organ which would be missed by nasal swab. So people continue to have long COVID symptoms\n2. Viral pieces stick around in the body causing symptoms for a long time or\n3. COVID causes the body to start attacking itself (autoimmune type disease).\n\nAnother mystery is that some with initial asymptomatic infection mount long COVID down the road. Something (or more likely a combination of somethings) trigger it.\n\nSo what can we do to prevent or at least reduce the burden of long COVID?\n\n***Vaccines***\nBefore the roll-out we hypothesized vaccines would prevent infection (and thus prevent long COVID). We also hypothesized vaccines would reduce viral load among breakthrough cases. Vaccines minimize the time the virus is in the body and reduces the number of infectious particles. So the less virus the less likelihood of damaging organs and the less likelihood of long COVID.\n\nNow that vaccines have been around for almost 12 months the vaccine’s impact on long COVID is starting to surface. And the results are encouraging. There have been three studies thus far.\n\n***First study***\nThe first study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Scientists investigated breakthrough cases among healthcare workers in Israel from December 19 2020 to April 28 2021 (before Delta). They wanted to describe the rate and symptoms of breakthrough cases. What did they find?\n-Out of 1497 vaccinated (with Pfizer) there were 39 breakthrough cases\n-Among the breakthrough cases 19% had symptoms lasting more than 6 weeks (i.e. long COVID). This included loss of smell cough fatigue weakness difficulty breathing and/or muscle pain.\nSo long COVID19 can occur with breakthrough cases but it’s relatively rare. In this study the rate of long COVID19 among vaccinated was 0.5%.\n\n***Second study***\nA second more recent and much larger study was published in the Lancet. It compared the rates of long COVID19 among vaccinated to unvaccinated adults in the UK. The scientists leveraged a massive sample (1240009 adults). They assessed the rate of partially vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after 1st dose but before 2nd dose) and rate of fully vaccinated breakthrough cases (positive test after dose 2).

***Efficacy against mild and moderate disease is reduced***
We have been trying to nail down the “real world” efficacy of mRNA vaccines against Delta. This has proven to be difficult to do. As I wrote before we’ve been getting mixed signals from the UK (showing an efficacy rate of 88%) and Israel (showing an efficacy rate of 64% at first and 39% now).

Yesterday the UK (Imperial College) released results from their ongoing study called UK REACT-1. Every month this team analyzes how vaccines continue to work against the virus. The latest data is now out. From 24 June to 12 July 2021 98233 volunteers in the UK were tested for COVID19. Among these people 527 tested positive; all were Delta. After asking vaccination status vaccine effectiveness was calculated. Vaccine effectiveness was 49% for any positive (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and 59% for symptomatic disease. In other words vaccinated people had a 59% reduced risk of getting symptomatic COVID19 compared to unvaccinated.

So the Israel numbers and the UK numbers are slowly agreeing: Delta significantly reduces effectiveness against symptomatic disease. No wonder we keep seeing more and more breakthrough cases in the United States.

Importantly though the vaccines continue to hold up for severe disease and death. At this point this is nothing short of a miracle. The vaccine is saving a ton of lives right now.

***Viral load among vaccinated is the same as unvaccinated***
This week three studies (here here and here) came out showing that vaccinated have the same viral load as unvaccinated. This means vaccinated can spread the virus. This evidence slowly confirms the famous Massachusetts outbreak study which promoted the CDC to recommend masks again. One study (here) this week showed lower viral load among vaccinated but not by much.

***…at least in the first six days.***
Another study from Singapore this week confirmed that the viral load among vaccinated is the same among the unvaccinated. However and importantly it looks like this is only the case in the first six days. Then the vaccine kicks in and there’s a far faster decline in viral load than among the unvaccinated (see graph). So at first the vaccinated are as infectious as unvaccinated but quickly differentiates over time. Vaccinated seem to not be infectious after 9 days (Ct=30) compared to unvaccinated at 16 days.

***Bottom line***
This confirms the higher rate of breakthrough cases than we anticipated. But the breakthrough cases continue to be far more mild than unvaccinated cases. Vaccinated also seem to carry the virus. So wear those masks and remain vigilant. Especially if you have unvaccinated or vulnerable family at home.

Florida: 

"" Florida children’s hospitals see pediatric COVID cases soar amid delta variant surge""

""At South Florida children’s hospitals in recent weeks emergency room doctors have seen more symptomatic children than they did during the surges in spring and summer of 2020 said Dr. Ronald Ford chief medical officer for Memorial Healthcare System’s Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood.

“In our previous iteration of the pandemic it was more they’re positive but they’re not sick or minimally sick” Ford said of the pandemic’s changing impact on children. “This is different. ... There’s a much higher percentage of pediatric patients becoming infected and symptomatic.”
The number of patients presenting at Memorial Health and Joe DiMaggio Children’s emergency rooms with COVID also has exploded Ford said from 23 in June to 240 in July a nearly 1000% increase."" (7)

Georgia: 
""Child cases have also exploded in recent weeks across the state. In mid-July 75 children tested positive. By Aug. 3 the number of cases had ballooned to more than 450 according to data from the Georgia Department of Public Health — a sixfold increase. "" Additional COVID-19 data is available at ."" (3)

Louisiana:

Arkansas: 
"" More Arkansas kids are getting COVID-19 and they are getting sicker "" 
Arkansas cases in the under 18 age group have increased by 517% in three months.
From April through July the state saw a 270% increase in coronavirus-related hospitalizations of people under 18.
Why it matters: School starts back in a couple of weeks. Kids under 12 cannot get vaccinated and unless the legislature amends Act 1002 during its special session Wednesday school districts cannot require masks.
Nearly half of Arkansas kids ages 12–18 have no immunization. A little more than 18% of the age group is fully vaccinated and another 32.2% are partially vaccinated.

State of play: Arkansas Childrens Hospital in Little Rock and Arkansas Childrens Northwest in Springdale had a combined total of 21 COVID-19 patients as of Monday spokesperson Hilary DeMillo tells Axios.
Eight of the patients are in the ICU and five are on ventilators."" (5)

Georgia: 
""Georgia hospitals report spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations""
""The vast majority of those hospitalized were not vaccinated hospital officials said. That is discouraging nurses and other hospital staff who say a surge could have been prevented had more people opted for the vaccine.""
"" Elizabeth Larkins executive director of medical nursing at Northeast Georgia Health System said her teams of nurses and respiratory therapists are exhausted."" (6)

Texas: 
""DUAL SURGE: HOUSTON DOCTORS SEE INCREASE IN CHILDREN HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO COVID-19 AND RSV"" 
""We are dealing with really a dual surge here. Two respiratory viruses that have converged in the summer of 2021"" said Dr. Jim Versalovic the interim pediatrician-in-chief and pathologist-in-chief at Texas Childrens Hospital.""

There’s no lack of anecdotal evidence that pediatric hospitals are reaching capacity in many states. But anecdotal evidence can be very different than population-level evidence. So what are we seeing on a population-level? And is there anything we should be concerned about?

***Epidemiology***
In the past week 121427 kids tested positive for COVID19 which represented 18% of the weekly reported cases in the United States. This is increasing at an exponential rate but adult cases are also increasing exponentially.

In 23 states 1.9% of child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization. Last Saturday 1902 kids were hospitalized for COVID19. The CDC has also made MIS-C (serious condition associated with COVID-19) data publicly available. As of July 31 4404 kids were diagnosed with MIS-C associated with COVID19 in the United States.

We are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of risk for severe disease as older adults. But even given this I’m still concerned about three things…

***First the rate in which hospitalizations are increasing.*** We are far beyond the January peak which is particularly apparent in the South (second graph). This could be due to pandemic fatigue (we just don’t care anymore). Or this could be due to Delta being more serious than previous variants. There is preliminary evidence from Scotland and Canada that adult hospitalization is more severe with Delta. We have yet to see kid data but I don’t have reason to believe that it’s different.

***Second pediatric ICU (PICU) capacity.*** We desperately need to flatten the pediatric hospital curve. Only ~38% of kids have “natural” immunity and the majority of kids aren’t eligible for vaccines which means we have an estimated 34 million susceptible children in the United States. If 1.9% of infected children are hospitalized 33% of the kids go to the PICU and the average hospital stay is 4 days that means we need 6800 PICU beds. The U.S. only has 4500 PICU beds total. (If you want to check the math go to this amazing thread by Dr. Denise Dewald).

We could easily overwhelm our pediatric hospitals. And this is just with COVID19. RSV is also at an all time high. Car accidents and drownings for example are also still happening in the background. We can’t just put kids in adult hospital beds. Kids aren’t tiny adults they need special equipment correct dosages and trained hospital staff (who are getting more and more difficult to find because they are burned out). We also can’t just systematically fly children from Texas (where hospitals are full) to Maryland (where hospitals aren’t full).

What schools do (or do not do) will impact case growth and thus impact how our hospitals fare too. A group of scientists in North Carolina modeled what may happen across schools that implement masks and/or surveillance testing. Without masks or regular testing up to 90% of susceptible students may become infected by the end of the semester.  

***Third kids’ role in the transmission chain.*** Yesterday an important study was published in JAMA. Scientists sought out to answer how kids of all ages transit COVID19 in Canadian households from June 1 and December 31 2020. They studied both the index cases and the rate of transmission in the household.

Out of 89191 households 6280 households had a pediatric index case
-The proportion of index cases increased with age. For example 12% of households had an index case aged 0 to 3 years and 38% had an index case aged 14 to 17 years
-Younger index cases had a higher proportion associated with a school/childcare outbreak than older kids
-Kids aged 4 to 8 years and 9 to 13 years had higher proportion with no symptoms reported compared with index case individuals aged 14 to 17 years or aged 0 to 3 years

1717 households (27%) experienced secondary transmission (i.e. spread in the house)
-Of these households the index case passed it on average to 2 other household members
-Younger children (aged 0-3) were more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 compared with older children (aged 14-17). This was irrespective of factors such as symptoms school/childcare reopening or school/childcare outbreaks. 

This study tells us that we will not stop transmission in the community without stopping transmission among kids especially younger kids. This is not only important for pediatric health but also for adults’ health and to stop this virus from mutating.

***Bottom Line:*** We aren’t sure if this pediatric case increase is the iceberg or just the tip of the iceberg. Delta may be changing the severity of disease but we have yet to see the science for children. Children could certainly overwhelm hospitals and play an important role in transmission. The next few months will be critical for our children and our community.

***bottom line:*** we aren’t sure if this pediatric case increase is the iceberg or just the tip of the iceberg delta may be changing the severity of disease but we have yet to see the science for children children could certainly overwhelm hospitals and play an important role in transmission the next few months will be critical for our children and our community

On behalf of the Superintendent please be advised that based on the Governor’s decision through Executive Order to end the Public Health State of Emergency on June 30 2021 and the significant improvement of the state of public health we are returning to pre-pandemic school operations for the 2021-22 school year which begins Thursday August 5 2021. 

At this time Floyd County Schools (FCS) will not issue mandated precautionary quarantines to students or staff for close contact at school with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  

When Principals are informed of a positive case among students or staff they will notify any affected staff and email parents of affected students notifying them of the positive case. It is important to monitor for symptoms but no precautionary quarantines will be required. This is the same State-mandated practice FCS follows for other serious communicable diseases.  

Students or staff who test positive for COVID-19 will continue to follow Department of Public Health guidelines which require you to stay home for 10 days since symptoms first appeared and are fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications for 24 hours before returning to school.  

Staff and students are not required to wear masks in FCS schools or offices at any time but can choose to wear them.  FCS will continue to provide disposable masks or neck gaiters to individuals who might request them. 

COVID-19 vaccinations are not required for employees or students but are encouraged and recommended.  The Floyd County Health Department and many local healthcare providers have COVID-19 vaccines readily available; FCS will continue to host COVID-19 vaccination events at FCS schools or offices at appropriate times if needed.

Schools will return to their normal operating procedures for lunchtime and class bell schedules. Parents/guardians and visitors will not be allowed in our schools at this time. FCS may reassess this practice after the Labor Day holiday depending on the health and safety of students and staff at that time. Entrance will be restricted to business-essential and scheduled meetings only.

FCS will continue to invest in increased cleaning and sanitizing at all school locations and will continue to provide surface and hand sanitizer spray to classrooms common areas and buses. 

FCS encourages families to attend the open house events that begin on Monday August 2 2021 to meet the outstanding educators and staff members at their child’s school and see where their classrooms will be. Parents/Visitors will not be allowed in the building to walk their students to class on the first day of school. This procedure will ensure teachers and staff stay focused on getting all children settled in and acclimated to normal school days.

I just wanted to share my story and to see if anyone else has had any of the post covid problems that I am having. This is my second time having covid. I tester positive in December 2020. It was bad but no where near as bad as this time. I had both vaccines. One in March and the other in April. I started getting sick again on July 4th 2021. I received a positive covid test a few days later. In August I was getting sicker so I went to the ER and was diagnosed with covid-pneumonia. In September I was still sick and was told that I have bronchitis. By this point I have had 2 steroid shots as well as taken multiple antibiotics. I also took 2 rounds of steroid pills. I had to go back to the ER a few weeks ago because of chest pain and problems breathing. They gave me another shot of steroids more steroid pills to take after the next day and a breathing treatment. My covid and flu test were negative and I was told my chest x-ray and ekg were normal. In between all the antibiotics and steroids I had gotten oral thrush which eventually went to my throat and stomach. That was very miserable. It is now December and I am still sick. As soon as I get out of bed I start coughing to the point of gagging and almost throwing up. When I cough it almost always makes me use the bathroom (#1) on myself ( I know thats gross but wanted to know if this has happened to anyone else) My chest back both sides and even my pelvic area has been in severe pain for a few days now. I dont even want to get out of bed. My nose mouth throat and eyes are always dry as sand and hurt. My head hurts almost everyday. My stomach has been giving me issues and I am not sure how to explain it other than it feels like I am pushing my stomach out as far as I can (Maybe bloating or pressure?) Also it feels like something is inside my stomach trying to push my ribs out of my body on both side. I am not sure if this is my lungs muscles or ribs but it hurts badly. I am not sure if this is just me or not but My Husband and Brother say they dont smell anything. But Its like I constantly smell bleach or chlorine. Or like I have it in my nose or something. The doctors always say everything looks good etc.. But I am almost to the point where I cant take it anymore. I cant do anything anymore from all the pain and giving out of breath easily as well as the exhaustion. I dont know what else to do. in 4 days  it will be 5 months. These symptoms are weird and no one seems to believe me. I was just wondering if anyone else was dealing with these issues? Any help will be appreciated. I am so sorry that this post is so long.

91,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1083268362422022,facebook,Sorry it’s a long post… I have been on the page for a while but this will be the first time I share my Covid story… 8 weeks ago my daughter started a fever and because I babysit kids we both tested for Covid and it was positive. I tried to get an appointment with my PCP but they couldn’t get me in for 2 days and I wanted to be treated from day one. I chose to go to a Quick Care clinic. I was retested there and because I’m allergic to Penicillin and Prednisone causes chest pains they sent me home with an RX for Pearls pills for coughing. They told me to get plenty of rest and orders for X-ray. A few days go by and fever started then diarrhea. I wasn’t hungry at all I had to force myself to eat a banana but I kept drinking water and Gatorade. On day 10 I was so weak I ended up having my son drive me to local ER. I was so weak he had to sign me in I couldn’t stand long enough. They took me to the back for vitals said my oxygen level was too low they were going to admit me. I was shocked I didn’t feel like my breathing was bad I walked and talked and did everything on my own. They put me in a bed on oxygen some antibiotics and told me to sleep and let lungs heal. Day 2 I could no longer get up and do anything for myself a week later I was brought to ICU. I remember absolutely NOTHING about going to ICU they say I fought them and didn’t want to keep my oxygen on so they moved me. One nurses aide was so happy to see me out of ICU and she told me she remembered that night I went because they tied me down…I don’t recall that and I’m not sure she had the correct person but she said it was me🤷🏻‍♀️ I do remember one thing they did a Covid test on me and the person that did the test went all the way back to Kindergarten memories with that Qtip and I did fight her because it HURT!!!! Out of ICU 3 days later spent the rest of my days trying to get them to lower my oxygen levels so I could go home. I fought the Dr to put me on nebulizer treatments and he fought back saying it wasn’t protocol. I told him not to treat me as a Covid patient to treat me as a pneumonia patient…he finally agreed to nebulizer treatments but then the nurses wouldn’t give it to me kept saying it was against protocol. I told them to check my chart which they came back and said I see it’s there but we have to get Respiratory Therapy to come give it to you. After 2 neb treatments I had improved enough they turned my oxygen down 20 liters in one day they did turn me back up 5 liters that evening. It took me another week to get me to going home level. I left hospital after 29 days on 3 liters. When I got home I was moving around a lot more so we had to turn it up to 5. I have been home 3 weeks and am currently on 1 1/2 liters of oxygen. If you have taken the time to read all of this I have a couple of question. 1. I have coughed very little and have coughed up hardly nothing anybody else? Did you finally start coughing up any mucous? I feel like this won’t go away until I do! 2. My oxygen levels are great unless I stand up and walk my heart rate goes up to around 112-115 sometimes up to 121. My oxygen used to drop to 87-89 but the last 3 days it’s dropping to around 81-82 not sure why it’s gone down instead of up? 3. I have my first pulmonologist appointment this Wednesday did anybody else need a wheelchair for mobility?

92,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/987738651974994,facebook,Edited post:My husband tested positive for covid and was hospitalized on 2/11/21. Last week he was able to come home and finally see the kids again…and start his road to recovery. He weighed 216 lbs when he was first hospitalized and was 149lbs when he got home. He spent 43 days sedated on a ventilator. He was life flighted from the initial hospital after the first day on the ventilator to another hospital 2 1/2 hours away from home bc they felt his covid pneumonia was so severe he would benefit from the ECMO but thankfully he began responding to the ventilator and pronation regimen of 18 hours/6 hours on back. Before he was intubated he could tell he was getting thrush while at the first hospital when he was on the BiPap mask. He kept telling them to look and they kept saying that it wasn’t thrush and by the time he was told he had to go on a ventilator the thrush was all over his mouth and down the back of his throat. During the first intubation he woke up from the sedation and as they where working on getting him sedated again apparently they didn’t realize the cuff bursted until his vitals all dropped and they had to reintubate him again. For the next 3 weeks he was in and out of sedation while on the ventilator and every time he woke up he asked if he could have the tube removed bc he was so uncomfortable..from the tube itself but also bc his thrush. So they decided his stats were close enough to let him “try” to breath on his own and allowed him to remove it (hindsight 20/20 I would have gone with my gut and insisted they not I knew in my heart he wasn’t able to breath on his own yet). That was one of the scariest moments of my life - as soon as they removed the tube I knew he wouldn’t be able to breath on his own. Seth tried so very hard to remain calm and try to breath but within minutes he was beginning to panick and I asked them to please reintubate him. They called anesthesia and it took what seemed like a lifetime for them to show up and I thought the entire time he was not gonna make it before they had a chance to reintubate him. His heartrate went up so high I remember not looking at the monitor after it his 155 he was panicking and it was obvious he wasn’t getting enough air. They did finally get him reintubated and it was two days later they trached him and during that procedure they found out that he had he had developed bacterial pneumonia. The follow day he had a partial lung collapse and it seemed like the next month was constant two steps forward and 4 steps back he was plagued by numerous secondary infections…and when he was finally able to transfer from the LTAC hospital to the rehabilitation facility the first night the nurse on staff was not familiar with feeding tubes and set his feeding on a rate that was too high and he ended up aspirating the feeding tube food. He tried getting help and pushed the call button - but apparently it was during shift change and no one came for over an hour to assist him. (At the time he was still too weak to walk on his own and couldn’t speak at all). He ended up in the ICU after that for over a week fighting the pneumonia but also dealing with nonstop nausea and vomiting..by the time he was able to go back to rehab he had lost another 5 lbs and had major anxiety - so I demanded to be allowed to stay with him 24/7 during the next week. It was so tough. I am sure everyone who has been through this has their own horror story and understands the difficulty and extreme emotional toll that is caused by COVID. It is so scary. Thankfully we are past the worst and even though he is home he ￼is still battling many of the same issues I have read about on recent posts on here. He has managed to walk on his own now and can go throughout a majority of the day without the need for oxygen. He still uses it during therapy and at nighttime. I wanted to see how many people have had issues with the ability to move their tongue dysphagia or impaired speech and what treatments you have done that have helped. He is on a feeding tube until he can regain his ability to swallow. His speech has gotten clearer since his trache was removed but his ability to move his tongue was severely impaired and that obviously affects his speech and his ability to swallow. He is doing speech therapy as well as PT and OT. His tongues range of motion has gotten a little better - and we did request an MRI numerous times and was able to get one when he was in ICU for the aspirating pneumonia. It didn’t show any signs of a stroke but did indicate inflammation (but the doctor said there was no way to tell if it was from covid or from time itself). The speech pathologist that we had while in rehab was very knowledgeable about covid related issues and said that MRIs for covid related issues do not show any issues -but from her assessment of him she said everything indicated the vagus nerve was affected somehow and it was the cause of the issues he is having with the (truncated),['testing' 'treatments'],['health' 'covid'],2812,0.0167546504283994,2022-10-13 21:11:29.544614,2021-06-06 10:13:22+00:00,11150438|987738651974994,{'platformId': '669615740453955_987738651974994' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2021-06-06 10:13:22' 'updated': '2022-06-08 22:16:19' 'type': 'photo' 'message': 'Edited post:My husband tested positive for covid and was hospitalized on 2/11/21. Last week he was able to come home and finally see the kids again…and start his road to recovery. He weighed 216 lbs when he was first hospitalized and was 149lbs when he got home. He spent 43 days sedated on a ventilator. He was life flighted from the initial hospital after the first day on the ventilator to another hospital 2 1/2 hours away from home bc they felt his covid pneumonia was so severe he would benefit from the ECMO but thankfully he began responding to the ventilator and pronation regimen of 18 hours/6 hours on back.

93,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1221087048640152,facebook,Hi everyone… I’m new here. And honestly scared. UPDATE: It is now Sunday and since late afternoon on Saturday (probably around 4-5 pm) I’ve been sneezing. I’ve taken Claritin D 24 hr to try and help and I’m STILL sneezing and my nose is so itchy inside. I’ve decided on Monday I’ll call my Pulmonologist because I need to be checked for Covid Pneumonia. Any advice for the sneezing? Also my nose is getting very sore and dried out around my nasal openings I’ve been putting gentle lotion on it but would coconut oil work better? I don’t want it getting raw. Thank you all so much for your comments this far! ❤️❤️ I’ve been sick since Tuesday (5/17). My first symptoms were coughing up phlegm diarrhea intense stomach cramping and vomiting (no nausea). It started around 7:30 AM EST and stayed that way until around 9:30 PM. Around that time the stomach cramps finally subsided however I had diarrhea and vomiting into Wednesday afternoon. I had been alternating drinking water and Gatorade to stay hydrated (still am). Wednesday afternoon I developed a cough that made my whole body retch. Tuesday thru Wednesday I had been taking Imodium and Midol laying on a heating pad and taking several hot showers as well as using my nebulizer. Wednesday night around 8 PM I developed a low grade fever of 99.8° and a headache. Thursday morning when my doctors office opened I called and got in to be seen. Thursday I was feeling a little better no diarrhea and I only vomited once but I still have the cough and I felt hot. My doctor asked to test me and I almost said no… She did a rapid test and it came back positive and I sat in her office and cried. Oh I cried… Some backstory on me is I’m chronically ill. I’ve had asthma since I was a toddler and as I got older I was fine up until 2018. I got pneumonia and had it for 6 months which got me a wonderful pulmonologist. She got me better but I’ve been a magnet for germs since. Just a week and a half ago I had double pink eye and now I have Covid!! I’ve gotten every cold stomach bug or nasty little germ that goes around but avoided Covid. I wore my mask sanitized washed my hands social distanced got both my vaccines and was careful! Having pneumonia for as long as I did really did a number on my lungs and my asthma has gotten worse since. My pulmonologist told me I was at increased risk and gave me a stern talking to. I listened to her warnings. Yet here I am. Given these factors I’m scared of Long Haulers. So Thursday I tested positive. I went immediately home to rest. My appointment was at 3:00 pm and I believe I was home by 4:30. Around 8:00 I got a massive headache and put ice packs on my head and tried to sleep. I took my temperature before laying down and was at 100.1°F. I took some Tylenol and tried to sleep. I slept from 9:30 pm to about 11:45 pm when I woke up hardly breathing. I was taking very long shallow breaths and just focusing on oxygen. I managed to fall back asleep until 3:00 am when I decided to nebulize. That helped me settle back in to sleep from 3:45 - 9:00 am. I woke up freezing stiff and exhausted. We are now at Friday morning. Friday I spent the whole day in bed on a heating pad resting. I wasn’t able to sleep much but I did watch a bunch of tv and just tried to relax. I nebulized when I needed to and hydrated. Friday evening came and by 7:30 pm I had the worst headache I’ve ever had (and I’m a migraine sufferer). I also had a fever of 101.3° by this time. I was watching my blood oxygen level and it dropped to 93%. I took Tylenol nebulized and called my mom at that point. She lives 3 hrs from me and I asked her to come down. She hopped in her car and was here by 11:30. She got me some Aleve gave me a popsicle and gave me a cold Gatorade. I believe my fever broke on Friday at some point. It is now Saturday night and I have had no diarrhea vomiting fever or stomach cramps. I haven’t had to take any medicine for those things. However due to all the horrible coughing my ribs and back are beginning to get very sore and hurt. My oxygen levels have been good today only dropping to 94% at the lowest. I have had several dizzy spells today lost my balance once and almost fell and have had a very heavy chest with the same cough. I’m just wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience/symptoms as I have? I know this is long and I apologize. I’m 24 chronically ill compromised and scared. I want to go back to my pulmonologist to have her take a look at me but I’m still on my parents insurance and they are funny about these things. I think my pulmonologist would want to know and for sure want to see me back. My lungs never X-ray well so I know I will immediately be given orders for a CT scan with contrast and she will want to culture my phlegm to see what’s growing in my lungs.. Should I contact her and be seen? I really don’t know how to react to Covid I don’t know what the proper reaction to it is anymore.

(probably around 4-5 pm) i’ve been sneezing i’ve taken claritin d 24 hr to try and help and i’m still sneezing and my nose is so itchy inside i’ve decided on monday i’ll call my pulmonologist because i need to be checked for covid pneumonia any advice for the sneezing also my nose is getting very sore and dried out around my nasal openings i’ve been putting gentle lotion on it but would coconut oil work better i don’t want it getting raw thank you all so much for your comments this far ❤️❤️ i’ve been sick since tuesday (5/17) my first symptoms were coughing up phlegm diarrhea intense stomach cramping and vomiting (no nausea) it started around 7:30 am est and stayed that way until around 9:30 pm around that time the stomach cramps finally subsided however i had diarrhea and vomiting into wednesday afternoon i had been alternating drinking water and gatorade to stay hydrated (still am) wednesday afternoon i developed a cough that made my whole body retch tuesday thru wednesday i had been taking imodium and midol laying on a heating pad and taking several hot showers as well as using my nebulizer wednesday night around 8 pm i developed a low grade fever of 998° and a headache thursday morning when my doctors office opened i called and got in to be seen thursday i was feeling a little better no diarrhea and i only vomited once but i still have the cough and i felt hot my doctor asked to test me and i almost said no… she did a rapid test and it came back positive and i sat in her office and cried oh i cried… some backstory on me is i’m chronically ill i’ve had asthma since i was a toddler and as i got older i was fine up until 2018 i got pneumonia and had it for 6 months which got me a wonderful pulmonologist she got me better but i’ve been a magnet for germs since just a week and a half ago i had double pink eye and now i have covid i’ve gotten every cold stomach bug or nasty little germ that goes around but avoided covid i wore my mask sanitized washed my hands social distanced got both my vaccines and was careful having pneumonia for as long as i did really did a number on my lungs and my asthma has gotten worse since my pulmonologist told me i was at increased risk and gave me a stern talking to i listened to her warnings yet here i am given these factors i’m scared of long haulers so thursday i tested positive i went immediately home to rest my appointment was at 3:00 pm and i believe i was home by 4:30 around 8:00 i got a massive headache and put ice packs on my head and tried to sleep i took my temperature before laying down and was at 1001°f i took some tylenol and tried to sleep i slept from 9:30 pm to about 11:45 pm when i woke up hardly breathing i was taking very long shallow breaths and just focusing on oxygen i managed to fall back asleep until 3:00 am when i decided to nebulize that helped me settle back in to sleep from 3:45 - 9:00 am i woke up freezing stiff and exhausted we are now at friday morning friday i spent the whole day in bed on a heating pad resting i wasn’t able to sleep much but i did watch a bunch of tv and just tried to relax i nebulized when i needed to and hydrated friday evening came and by 7:30 pm i had the worst headache i’ve ever had (and i’m a migraine sufferer) i also had a fever of 1013° by this time i was watching my blood oxygen level and it dropped to 93% i took tylenol nebulized and called my mom at that point she lives 3 hrs from me and i asked her to come down she hopped in her car and was here by 11:30 she got me some aleve gave me a popsicle and gave me a cold gatorade i believe my fever broke on friday at some point it is now saturday night and i have had no diarrhea vomiting fever or stomach cramps i haven’t had to take any medicine for those things however due to all the horrible coughing my ribs and back are beginning to get very sore and hurt my oxygen levels have been good today only dropping to 94% at the lowest i have had several dizzy spells today lost my balance once and almost fell and have had a very heavy chest with the same cough i’m just wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience/symptoms as i have i know this is long and i apologize i’m 24 chronically ill compromised and scared i want to go back to my pulmonologist to have her take a look at me but i’m still on my parents insurance and they are funny about these things i think my pulmonologist would want to know and for sure want to see me back my lungs never x-ray well so i know i will immediately be given orders for a ct scan with contrast and she will want to culture my phlegm to see what’s growing in my lungs should i contact her and be seen i really don’t know how to react to covid i don’t know what the proper reaction to it is anymore i

I really hoped I wouldnt be making anything but a positive update post on here five months after having covid in early February of this year... but here I am. So my initial symptoms started two weeks after covid: Ive had GI issues (indigestion heartburn gas cramping) then facial flushing after eating to the point of my face being hot to the touch of course the severe congestion in my nose that caused the temporary loss of taste and smell (I was lucky) and ear congestion which caused tinnitus and lasted what seemed like forever three months. Insomnia (not falling asleep but waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and feeling wired). Of all of those I only still have the mild tinnitus off and on now but it has calmed down a lot. I thought I had the insomnia under control using pepcid hydroxizine and magnesium. But I dont know anymore. The unpredictability of all of this is maddening. I am grateful to have had minimal symptoms between the tinnitus and insomnia during the month of May which was my wedding month. 🙏 After my wedding two weeks ago I decided to try starting adderall due to lack of focus and struggle at work and the stimulant has been helping me very well. I take the immediate release (supposed to last 4/5 hours) right after I wake up in the morning. I also started a second job this month that was only scheduling me 10/15 hours a week at the beginning. Well this week they scheduled me 25 hours. I thought I could handle it but I guess I overestimated myself. I bought a smart watch to help track my sleep after the wedding and Ive been getting decent sleep of 7/8 hours a night sometimes waking up but falling right back asleep not too long after. Well this week... Ive been getting less and less sleep. But this time its having trouble falling asleep. 7 hours on Sunday down to 6.5 hours and then 6 hours then 5 hours last night. I have completely burnt myself out I think because today I felt horrible. I couldnt enjoy my night off. I went to bed at 10 thinking I could take a melatonin to fall asleep by midnight (always works) but it didnt work this time. I am still up at 2:30 a.m and had to send a message to my new boss saying I couldnt work tomorrow because I wont be able to function on no sleep. We also went out with friends to eat mexican food which I havent had problems with since two months after covid and tonight it messed my stomach up so bad. Tmi but I immediately had to go to the bathroom after eating then again when I got home and I still feel nauseous. Ive taken melatonin pepto bismol xanax and some nerve tonic to try to relax and go to sleep. But every time my brain is just about to shut off I know it sounds weird but I see flashes of light in my eyes and then my heart starts racing. I dont regularly use the HR feature on my smart watch but I did and it was 114bpm right after almost falling asleep. This has happened three times so far tonight. Now I feel wide awake so Im not even trying to lay down and go to sleep. I really wish I could get control of my body again.... the insomnia is what scares me the most. Also I forgot to mention that Ive noticed that Ive been losing more hair than normal for the past month. Not nearly as bad as most people on here and I dont really notice any balding spots yet but it is definitely more than I am used to. My scalp started itching tonight after eating also and I noticed a red spot and flakiness on my scalp. I have been itching off/on tonight. :( Trying not to scratch which also makes it hard to get comfortable to fall asleep. Ive never ever had itchy scalp like this. I am wondering if I ate something bad at the mexican restaurant that caused all of this to flare up or the large amount of salsa caused it (tomatoes are high in histamines). I just dont get it though Ive been eating mexican food up until now with no issues since March. Also I took an at home covid test and it was clearly negative not even a faint line. I have also been noticeably urinating more recently even when I dont drink that much water (but today I have and electrolytes right now to see if it helps based off of what I have read here). I blame myself I am so ticked off at myself for right now. Maybe I pushed too hard with the second job and this is my relapse. But I needed extra money from paying for the wedding and my medical bills from February. I was doing SO GOOD these past two months. To be honest I dont follow these support group pages to see the posts pop up because I dont want to think about how I used to feel when Im feeling better.

96,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1179318842816973,facebook,Hi everyone. Rather new to this group and so thankful for all the continued love and support I witness you all having together. This is long so I apologize. Had Covid March 2020 and April of 2021. Thankfully recovered pretty well without any noticeable symptoms to follow. Fast forward to December 31st of 2021 my 3 year old son woke up with a fever. He had a runny nose a few days to follow. I eventually caught the same runny nose. I had done 4 at home tests and two PCR’s in the weeks to follow. All of them remained negative. I wasn’t eating well at the time trying to do a silly diet and was drinking emergen-c packets every day teas and vitamin c shots trying to avoid getting sick. I noticed on a few occasions I would randomly get fatigued. I attributed it to poor diet seeing a chiropractor for the first time in years and getting over my cold. January 14th we were at a late family holiday party(finding out the next day many of them had covid). I had a huge dinner (which wasn’t how i had been eating) I noticed that night I felt very winded while talking. Took a tums. Woke up the following morning with a racing heart and tight breathing. I again thought this was from a possible gastritis flare and sliding hiatal hernia. I had been checked again for covid/flu/rsv and had my lungs checked on x-ray. all was normal. About a week or so later i noticed nausea and diarrhea for a week straight. Then i started waking up a few days a week with palpitations and sometimes racing heart. I’ve had this happen from eating poorly before. Still negative for covid at the time. It all started to go down hill from there. Noticed mores days of fatigue and feeling dreamy. Eventually took myself to the ED. They ran many tests which were all normal including covid chest x-ray ekg heart enzymes d-dimer regular CBC. My potassium was on the lower end. I’ve had this a few times before. They gave me a potassium drink. An hour or so later i felt my body get a flushed hot feeling and i felt lightheaded. I have bad health anxiety so my heart rate went up to about 170-180 and thankfully came down. I went home with no answers and a ton of anxiety. Since then so many symptoms have presented. I wanted to believe it was simply a stomach flare that my anxiety has latched onto. I had a similar experience in 2016 that left me bedridden out of fear and not eating. At the time i also developed POTS. Thankfully with time lots of testing better diet and just pushing myself to get back out… i got better. I’m struggling so bad again. I’m scared to leave the house. My symptoms have me scared. I just need some guidance support and ideas. Wondering what everyone thinks of my situation. I will now list my symptoms. No appetite(no hunger cues no will to eat) dry mouth regurgitation/reflux/stomach burning soft yellow stools for 3 months palpitations mostly positionally higher heart rate standing and walking sometimes heavy tongue occasionally floaters in eyes light sensitivity Anxiety Depression/sadness nervousness brain fog derealization cold sensations down my legs wake up almost every day between 4am-7 am with what feel like adrenaline rushes uneasy nervousness nightmares which set the whole morning off. vertigo-especially when i first get up in the morning right diaphragm breathing cold feet pressure in right ear dry eyes I know so many of these could be from many causes. Especially because I went almost 6-7 weeks without eating maybe a piece of chicken a day. I notice when i eat i have some minor relief. I have a b12 deficiency which i take injections for monthly. i am type two diabetic. I check my sugar blood pressure and oxygen/hr often. I’ve had a full cardiac work up CT of head so much blood work from GI doctor primary rheumatologist and my endocrinologist. Thankfully all have come back pretty normal. My vitamin d is low-20. My ferritin is 30(even though it’s normal range it’s not optimal). I’m scheduled for an endoscopy this coming thursday. I’m so scared feeling so detached different so depressed and sad nervous and have this fear of never getting better. It’s taking away from my quality of life and routine with my son. I imagine many of us here have these feelings. I’m so sorry for everyone who had to deal with all of these symptoms plus more. We are blessed and lucky to have each other to reach out to. I pray every day we all start to find relief and positive healing. ❤️ Does any of this seem like long covid? I just don’t have any other explanation at this point.

In February 2020 I had been getting chronic sinus problems a headache that felt someone was hitting me over the head with a hammer and eventually I was slowing down at my job which normally I run all over a giant estate up stairs down stairs and I was out of breath. Went to my primary went to ENT who found some stuff like deviated septum etc. and a sinus infection. WEEKS later in first week of March I got progressively worse. Because I was having trouble with my normal running around I had an appointment with a pulmonary doctor scheduled (cant remember but think around 3-12-20). I began to wonder could I have COVID but when calling the NYS hotlines I was told I did not have the right symptoms and there was no place that could test me. The day before my scheduled appointment with pulmonary dr. I got so sick I couldnt stand up and the doctors office went from in-office visits to tele-visits only. By this time my eyes were on fire but no fever no cough. This angel of a doctor did his televisit with me and asked if I wanted to be tested. I explained NOWHERE in New York State would test me. He called me back and told me a drive through appointment was waiting for me at Danbury (connecticut) Hospital. I went and sure enough 24 hours later I was POSITIVE for COVID-19. I spent about two weeks just weak and feeling lousy but slowly got better. There are a couple of unknowns to me that I believe are still un-answered: 1. Why for weeks did I have this pounding headache and breathing issues and sinus pain? Could I have been positive for Covid that long? I dunno. 2. My 68 year old sister lives with me. She leaves on Mondays to go to her job in New Jersey where she sleeps until Thursdays. She left that Monday and by Wednesday I had the positive diagnosis. She never got sick and since they were reluctant back then to just test she never tested until months later she tested for antibodies and had none. We live in very small quarters and we were both surprised she didnt get it. In addition she works for a 90 year old man. He also stayed covid-free (thankfully). A year later right before my vaccine I was tested for antibodies and still had them so I also wonder how and why. Now we get to Winter 2021 - the holidays. My sister has been away with her daughter and husband since 12-23. They all just tested positive yesterday and all are vaccinated. They are also feeling pretty sick. My best friend who I was with the whole weekend before I originally tested is vaccinated boosted - she and her entire family all tested positive although they seem to have mild symptoms. So I guess what I am trying to say as I see people have so many questions -- is I think its impossible to really answer a lot of the questions we have because there are a million different situations for the same virus and variants. I will always question why I was sick for so many weeks before I finally went down for the count. How was my sister and best friend able to be around me when I was obviously contagious but they avoided the virus then but now got it?

98,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1292285081520348,facebook,Hi thanks for the add I am new to the group and have so many questions… I have been a mess since having a mild case of covid in January. Only 1/2 days were bad and I felt a lot of pain in my chest I took an antacid and it helped so I never thought about it again. Since then I’ve had intermittent high blood pressure GI issues breathing issues (this is my biggest issue) and horrific anxiety and panic attacks. Prior to covid I did have GI issues (hiatal hernia gastritis GERD IBS but is was manageable) I did NOT have breathing issues I have had anxiety in the past but nothing like what I’m dealing with now I also had raynauds interstitial cystitis and other weird little things I have seen soooooo many drs NONE will document long covid and instead tell me it’s anxiety (I was very stressed out at work for the past year+ so some of it definitely could be) all of my tests come back ok except my vitamin D 17 vitamin b12 271 CRP 10.2 and has increased ever since January I have had cat scans of my chest and abdomen  MRI (neck and brain) x rays abdominal doppler ultrasound veinous ultrasound and arterial doppler ultrasound. Number blood tests I just did the pulmonary function test but couldn’t complete it because they said I was too tense (they had me do the walking test and my O2 dropped into the 80s the nurse said that couldn’t be right so We walked back and he changed the batteries it was still low at 91-93 but it will just randomly dip and again maybe it’s from my anxiety and me thinking about it so much idk) My breathing issues feel like pressure in my chest and I will get pain in my upper back when trying to take a deep breath I have to yawn to get a good relaxation breath or I will just struggle to try to keep taking a deep breath and then I’m hyperventilating…I also get strange pressure in my sinuses. Randomly I will also feel like I’ve forgotten how to breathe and it literally feels like my muscles in my throat are not working at the same time and my mind wanting them to work. I feel like I’ve run really hard sometimes even with just sitting and will taste blood/a metallic taste ( not the same as with GERD I use to run and it’s more like that) What does asthma feel like? Could this be adult onset asthma (which all of my drs have said no to but I’ve lost faith in them) I have a hiatal hernia and GERD and gastritis and thought my breathing problems were coming from that but my GI dr said they aren’t. My O2 is usually ok 97/98 but it can dip into the low 90s when I’m walking or doing chores etc I have had echocardiogram and stress test combo it came back ok I have worn a heart monitor and it came back normal so they ruled out any heart issues I saw a pulmonologist and while doing the walk test with the O2 thing in my finger my oxygen dipped to 86 the nurse said that could be right and we walked back and he changed the batteries and then it was 91-93 he asked me if I was on oxygen and that freaked me out. I tried to do the pulmonary function test but when I put the plug on my nose my right ear plugged up and I started panicking and I tried to do the test but out of 10 I think I I only passed like 1-2 the nurse said I was too tense and they couldn’t get an accurate reading. When I actually saw the dr she had me describe my symptoms…I get pressure in my chest right under my sternum and right below it I have difficulty laying flat on my back and on my side sometimes and have to sit up because I feel like I’m suffocating I take short shallow breaths ALL DAY LONG and have to yawn or really struggle to get my relaxation breath I was recently diagnosed with severe anxiety and panic disorder after having covid in January but I have NEVER felt anything like this before I honestly feel like I’m losing my mind because of how little help drs have been The dr just gave me albuterol but I’m afraid to take it because of tachycardia which I now get randomly One more thing sometimes when I lay down For a while and get up I get the strangest sensation when I take the first 1/2 breaths like something is sticking or rubbing idk how to describe it but it just feels weird Any information.

99,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1041977639884428,facebook,Hello everyone. I’m here to share with you my story and what led up to my being pretty sick with COVID as I write to you. I’ve been a member of this group for many months. My parents and brother tested positive for COVID back in December while I was away at college. My parents landed in the hospital for three days each and I couldn’t see them for nearly a month missed holidays etc. I’ve been nervous about taking the vaccine. I stood firm in my decision to not get the vaccine because of my severe emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and the potential complications from the vaccine. However upon Delta’s emergence I decided to get vaccinated in the middle of July. My brother went with me and we received our second dose on August 4th meaning we were fully vaccinated as of August 18th with Pfizer. On the 18th I moved back to college early because I am a Peer Leader and needed to complete training. There were around 60 of us together in one classroom all day and night and masks were off during meals and water breaks. It only took a few days for someone to show up with mild symptoms but not tell anyone. They would eventually test positive and so would another person who shared a straw and drink with the original person who had COVID. Well I spent a lot of time close to person #2 this past Saturday and Sunday. I didn’t know that they were a close contact and was never notified (even after they tested positive) that I was one. However when I started feeling an agitated throat and fatigue on Monday I worried. I knew something was up. The school never contacted me but I decided to go for a rapid test yesterday morning. Needless to say it came back positive. Today I am feeling worse than yesterday. My symptoms include: Diarrhea runny & stuffy nose agitated throat fatigue confusion/dizziness in my head when I stand muscle & joint pain and occasional sinus and ear pressure. Before today I only had a runny & stuffy nose agitated throat dizziness when I stood and fatigue. I hope I don’t deteriorate any further. The possibility of me vomiting from COVID is making me feel so anxious because of my phobia and the fact that I have diarrhea (another GI complication). My parents took me home to isolate yesterday because the school wanted me to move all of my stuff by myself to the COVID dorm across town. They didn’t want me to be alone after that but I double-masked the whole car ride home and am taking precautions when I need to leave my room and go to the bathroom. I spray Lysol as I walk in the hallway to my bathroom (holding my breath) and wipe plates/cups down with Clorox before leaving them at my door for them to take away. (I’m going to talk to them about switching to plastic). I’m incredibly scared of infecting my parents even though they still had antibodies as of June 2021 because they are unvaccinated and have pre-existing conditions. Interestingly enough my mom had to undergo a procedure recently and tested positive for COVID weeks ago. The rest of us tested negative and none of us got sick but it’s likely she had it. That gives me some hope that they are protected. I don’t have any pre-existing conditions and am a fairly healthy 19 year-old-female who is very health-conscious and washes her hands raw as well as wipes everything down with Clorox and Lysol on a daily basis. I am very upset because I feel that I have always been super careful and clean during the pandemic and others aren’t taking it seriously. If I didn’t take it upon myself to get tested I would still be spreading it at school right now. It’s super disappointing that I now need to miss the Peer Leader events I have been training for sophomore re-orientation (because my grade never experienced orientation last year) and my first week of classes. Zooming into class is not an option so I need to get my work from my professions via. email and hope that I understand everything. (I’m super thankful that they are being so helpful and patient with me and offering to meet with me privately on zoom if need be.). I felt the need to write because I feel pretty isolated angry that I am sick after doing the right thing anxious of passing it to my parents and would really appreciate your prayers and sharing of similar experiences. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read all of this and I hope all of you your families and friends are staying happy healthy and safe.❤️ (Edit: I edited some things in this post just to clarify some things I got questions about. Also I’m going to talk to my family about switching to plastic utensils/plates/cups and going for microbial antibody infusion.

write to you i’ve been a member of this group for many months my parents and brother tested positive for covid back in december while i was away at college my parents landed in the hospital for three days each and i couldn’t see them for nearly a month missed holidays etc i’ve been nervous about taking the vaccine i stood firm in my decision to not get the vaccine because of my severe emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and the potential complications from the vaccine however upon delta’s emergence i decided to get vaccinated in the middle of july my brother went with me and we received our second dose on august 4th meaning we were fully vaccinated as of august 18th with pfizer on the 18th i moved back to college early because i am a peer leader and needed to complete training there were around 60 of us together in one classroom all day and night and masks were off during meals and water breaks it only took a few days for someone to show up with mild symptoms but not tell anyone they would eventually test positive and so would another person who shared a straw and drink with the original person who had covid well i spent a lot of time close to person #2 this past saturday and sunday i didn’t know that they were a close contact and was never notified (even after they tested positive) that i was one however when i started feeling an agitated throat and fatigue on monday i worried i knew something was up the school never contacted me but i decided to go for a rapid test yesterday morning needless to say it came back positive today i am feeling worse than yesterday my symptoms include: diarrhea runny & stuffy nose agitated throat fatigue confusion/dizziness in my head when i stand muscle & joint pain and occasional sinus and ear pressure before today i only had a runny & stuffy nose agitated throat dizziness when i stood and fatigue i hope i don’t deteriorate any further the possibility of me vomiting from covid is making me feel so anxious because of my phobia and the fact that i have diarrhea (another gi complication) my parents took me home to isolate yesterday because the school wanted me to move all of my stuff by myself to the covid dorm across town they didn’t want me to be alone after that but i double-masked the whole car ride home and am taking precautions when i need to leave my room and go to the bathroom i spray lysol as i walk in the hallway to my bathroom (holding my breath) and wipe plates/cups down with clorox before leaving them at my door for them to take away (i’m going to talk to them about switching to plastic) i’m incredibly scared of infecting my parents even though they still had antibodies as of june 2021 because they are unvaccinated and have pre-existing conditions interestingly enough my mom had to undergo a procedure recently and tested positive for covid weeks ago the rest of us tested negative and none of us got sick but it’s likely she had it that gives me some hope that they are protected i don’t have any pre-existing conditions and am a fairly healthy 19 year-old-female who is very health-conscious and washes her hands raw as well as wipes everything down with clorox and lysol on a daily basis i am very upset because i feel that i have always been super careful and clean during the pandemic and others aren’t taking it seriously if i didn’t take it upon myself to get tested i would still be spreading it at school right now it’s super disappointing that i now need to miss the peer leader events i have been training for sophomore re-orientation (because my grade never experienced orientation last year) and my first week of classes zooming into class is not an option so i need to get my work from my professions via email and hope that i understand everything (i’m super thankful that they are being so helpful and patient with me and offering to meet with me privately on zoom if need be) i felt the need to write because i feel pretty isolated angry that i am sick after doing the right thing anxious of passing it to my parents and would really appreciate your prayers and sharing of similar experiences thank you for taking time out of your day to read all of this and i hope all of you your families and friends are staying happy healthy and safe❤️ (edit: i edited some things in this post just to clarify some things i got questions about also i’m going to talk to my family about switching to plastic utensils/plates/cups and going for microbial antibody infusion i really really really appreciate all of the advice love prayers experiences and well wishes you are all sharing with me i’ll continue to read (and respond if possible) to all of them💗),15,0.0,0.4928595532697887
100,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/984089475673245,facebook,Hello everyone. I want to tell my journey with the virus. In late February I contracted the virus. I got tested at our local ER went home and called my boss and told her. She was very worried about me. I told her “God got this”. I remember my husband fixing me and ￼ omelette with cheese and ham. And the ham tasted like leather. I didn’t eat it. He said you need to eat. I told him I’d be ok. That’s the last I remember he said I pretty much gave up and told him I was just gonna lay there. At that point he called the EMT’s. Btw he also had the virus. They came to pick me up and I had a 28% oxygen level. The doctors told my family it would be a miracle if I lived thru the night. And if I did I would most likely have brain damage for the lack of oxygen. After the first day of being in ICU they gave me plasma. After having covid we have the antibodies and someone had donated there plasma with that in it and I got it. At that point my health started improving. I was in ICU for 13 days when I woke up. They had to give me a ￼ paralytic be causing I was fighting them. (I don’t like being tied down ). I was on some good drugs and was seeing things. Nurses asleep next to my bed and it was really my iv pole. Yeah good drugs. So they FINALY took the ventilator out and the nurse asked me if I knew where I was. And did I know why my husband had me here. I didn’t remember even being sick. I did a rundown of my body to see if I had any pain thinking maybe I had been in a wreck. Nope. Wasn’t that. So they told me. My nurse had my phone and asked if I wanted to talk to my daughter. She called her for me. We FaceTimed. I got to see her and my grandson she stayed right there with me holding my phone. She was amazing. We have Lived in about 8different states moving with the military so we know a lot of people. And those people sent out request for prayer for me. From all over the country people I will Probably never meet prayed for me. And is still praying for me. I read all y’all’s post about all the symptoms you have. I came home with oxygen couldn’t feed my self or walk after 2 weeks of being home I was walking after 2 days of being home I was feeding my self and after 3 weeks I was off oxygen. I still get tired when I walk a lot it I lost a lot of muscle. And now the only two things that I deal with is hair loss and my feet swelling. I know my healing all has to do with the people praying for me. I know my hair will grow back. And it doesn’t make it easy seeing it all come out. But I want to pray for you guys. To have the same healing as I have. So please send me your name and what is going on with you. Prayer really changed my life. There’s so much more I could tell you but it’s already a long post. Hope this will help some one to just hang on. ￼I know it’s hard.

Im coming up on my one-year Covid-ersary and I think about it A LOT! When my siblings and I tested positive back in November of 2020 we did not know at the time that Covid would pretty much turnour lives upside down (we also were already planning to get vaccinated but they were not available to the general public yet) 😩 My mom had just started chemo in October so Covid was just the little extra push we needed to make it worse! We had already been following guidelines social distancing etc. because I previously had Kidney Failure and my twin sister was coming up on her one-year Kidney Transplant-ersary 😂 so we were very careful... but we unfortunately caught it (Im thinking maybe from a clinic I was at for my regular doctor appointments!). My siblings all had very mild symptoms but I ended up with the worst side of things and ended up with Covid Pneumonia... by November 19th I was rushed to the hospital after passing out at home in the ICU by about the 21st and finally after talking with doctors and family on the vent by the 27th of November because my body was basically giving up. I was finally taken off the meds that were keeping me in a coma and started being aware of my surroundings by Christmas! I had lots of complications because of the Pneumonia added to the fact that I had Kidney Failure... I had was trached (twice - we were positive that everything was good when we took it out the first time but I ended up going inyo respiratory arrest again so it was placed back again for about another two weeks - biggest issues were my vocal cords being paralyzed)... I even shaved my head bald because with thick polynesian curly hair and not being able to wash it for weeks it was completely matted 😩 I spent about 2 1/2 months in the ICU befor finally being transferred to a rehab center for Physical and Occupational therapy for about 2 weeks. I spent 3 months away from home and away from my family! There are no words to explain the depressing thoughts I felt when I got home... I had to use a walker (at 34 very depressing for myself) a commode I had to have someone sleep in my room because breathing wasnt great yet and to help me to the restroom I spent an entire month in my room because I couldnt even walk or go to our kitchen and eat meals with my family! I had nurses PT & OT at my house a few times every week for about 2 months to help me regain my strength. Ive had many hospital visits since including Pneumonia again in July subglottic-stenosis which results in a brochoscopy and dilation of my airway (back in May and again yesterday) and just a lot of brain fog fatigue etc. Not to mention the mental aspect of this entire thing! TODAY I feel like I am at 85%! My family who have been such a huge huge support to me during this recovery just keep talking about how they didnt think I would be where I am at today! We had so many close calls where they wanted my family to sign a DNR while on the vent and they kept refusing! I havent used a walker or commode since about May and can now go on walks of more than 30-45 minutes and my o2 doesnt go below 97-99🙌🏽 I still have a bit of fatigue some brain fog and Im still dealing with PTSD (this will take time) but overall I keep pushing myself a little every single day to get back to where I want to be! We hear so many horror stories and hopelessness in this all so I hope that you all keep on fighting the good fight because when you come out at the end the feeling is beautiful! The little wins whether its doing a lap or two around your living room every hour or standing and cooking - even if its just a simple pot of ramen are so important and help!,['testing' 'vaccines'],['health' 'covid'],1422,0.0247042268202428,2022-10-15 16:27:53.152911,2021-10-27 03:42:39+00:00,13487526|599797708027649,"{'platformId': '373920943948661_599797708027649' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2021-10-27 03:42:39' 'updated': '2022-05-15 00:12:53' 'type': 'photo' 'message': ""I have been seeing so many stories of those who have survived Covid in general and thought I'd share mine in hopes of giving some the hope they need knowing you can beat this!

we were positive that everything was good when we took it out the first time but i ended up going inyo respiratory arrest again so it was placed back again for about another two weeks - biggest issues were my vocal cords being paralyzed) i even shaved my head bald because with thick polynesian curly hair and not being able to wash it for weeks it was completely matted 😩 i spent about 2 1/2 months in the icu befor finally being transferred to a rehab center for physical and occupational therapy for about 2 weeks i spent 3 months away from home and away from my family there are no words to explain the depressing thoughts i felt when i got home i had to use a walker (at 34 very depressing for myself) a commode i had to have someone sleep in my room because breathing wasn't great yet and to help me to the restroom i spent an entire month in my room because i couldn't even walk or go to our kitchen and eat meals with my family i had nurses pt & ot at my house a few times every week for about 2 months to help me regain my strength i've had many hospital visits since including pneumonia again in july subglottic-stenosis which results in a brochoscopy and dilation of my airway (back in may and again yesterday) and just a lot of brain fog fatigue etc not to mention the mental aspect of this entire thing today i feel like i am at 85% my family who have been such a huge huge support to me during this recovery just keep talking about how they didn't think i would be where i am at today we had so many close calls where they wanted my family to sign a dnr while on the vent and they kept refusing i haven't used a walker or commode since about may and can now go on walks of more than 30-45 minutes and my o2 doesn't go below 97-99🙌🏽 i still have a bit of fatigue some brain fog and i'm still dealing with ptsd (this will take time) but overall i keep pushing myself a little every single day to get back to where i want to be we hear so many horror stories and hopelessness in this all so i hope that you all keep on fighting the good fight because when you come out at the end the feeling is beautiful the little wins whether it's doing a lap or two around your living room every hour or standing and cooking -

FEBRUARY 2020 grumblings on the news about Covid but we are all operating as normal. I had headaches that felt like someone was hitting me over the head with a hammer. Went to my family doctor she sent me for some scans - nothing. Then I began having awful sinus issues thruoghout rest of February with awful pain in my right ear.

Around this time the town of New Rochelle NY was making headline news as COVID had made its way to this town probably spread by a gentleman who was involved with a large gathering - several people were affected from that group. A COVID TESTING site was opened in New Rochelle.

March 16th I am at work its around noon I turn to my co-worker and said ""I dont know what is wrong with me but I feel like Im dying and Im doing home right now"" and I literally ran out the door. I got home with diahrhea a pounding headache my eyes were burning and all red I felt my breathing was labored and I could hardly stand up. I called my doctor who said I needed to call the NYS Dept of Health hotline and request an appt. After a 90 minute wait on hold i was told I was not eligible to be tested. I then called the Pulmonary Doctor who I had an appt with the next day to tell him I was canceling. This doctor was my angel. He personally called me back and requested a televisit over the phone so he could see me. After speaking to me for ten minutes he simply asked ""do you want to get COVID tested"" to which I replied (crying) ""they wont test me because they said I have no symptoms"".... He then told me he would make it happen if I was willing to drive to Danbury Ct hospital. I immediately agreed Id go anywhere. Within ten minutes I had an appointment at Danbury Hospital. He also told me to purchase a pulsometer to check my oxygen levels. The next day I went to Danbury Hospital drive-through and had my first COVID test.

Ive wanted to post something for some time so here it goes. I got to say though please be nice because this is a little scary to me to be putting my personal life out here. But you have all helped us so Im trying to trust this wont backfire on me.... My husband got Covid Sept 2021. He has diabetes so we were very worried and extra cautious about isolating for the whole year and a half before he finally got it anyway. And he did get pretty sick but not sick enough to be hospitalized thankfully. Unfortunately he has suffered from major fatigue post Covid and just recently we got some answers as to why. More about that later. We believe I had a undocumented case of Covid in the winter/spring of 2020. I got sicker then I had ever been or have been since. All the classic symptoms too. Fever sore throat congestion headache dry cough fatigue and the most horrible body aches ever! And all that winter spring and summer I got every other illness going around and really I felt like I was getting mini cases of Covid all over again for months. I used to say to my husband ""I wonder if its possible to get Covid over and over again!"". Now I think it may be that the old original symptoms just keep recurring as a type of Long Covid response because that happened to my husband too for awhile maybe 6 months or so. But his fatigue has been the longest lasting symptom.... Recently I was traveling to help my daughter with her new baby and because I had been potentially exposed to Covid I got tested before I left with a rapid and PCR and I asked to have an antibodies test done too. Covid was all negative but when they got the results back for my antibodies test they called me. The Dr said I had most definitely had Covid at some point because my antibodies number was very high. I asked if that could be because of the vaccination and booster I had and he said no your antibodies do not get that high from the vaccination or booster. That was nice to have that confirmed to us that I did indeed have Covid at some point. Anyway Im grateful for this group. I actually dont post on Facebook but have discovered a lot of value in joining groups like this one. It has helped my husband to see your posts for feeling not so isolated and some validation and lots of good suggestions too. I read them often and in fact probably more than him and I forward some to my husband that I think will particularly help him to read. Everyone is at a different stage of recovery depending on when they got Covid or how many times and how sick they got or what part or parts of their body were affected.... But I want to say to all of you that I feel your pain and suffering and confusion and isolation and Im so sorry for everyone who has to go through this!! And I feel your hope too and I just want to say thank you for all your honesty and your suggestions because it is invaluable in a world where all of you are first timers in this awful Covid journey. Youve helped me a lot to support my husband too. I will be honest that as a partner it is hard for me to see my husband struggle especially energy wise but I know its hardest for him. But I want to say we should also be remembering that along with the long Covid survivors suffering the family who is living with the long Covid survivor is also going through disappointments in what this illness does or has done to our loved ones. Its never easy for the person suffering through it or the supportive family watching the loss of health too. Back to my husbands long Covid symptoms....Recently my husbands doctor ran some tests and it appears based on similar test results done pre Covid pretty regularly (because of his diabetes) that his endocrine system was profoundly affected from having Covid. His testosterone level is half as low as what is considered too low. And many times lower pre Covid. The doctor says that is most certainly why he is having so much fatigue! That was super helpful to get the why for him and me. He has just started hormone testosterone therapy and were hoping that helps him! And he also has a slight heart murmur too. He had one back in his youth but it appeared to have gone away or was undetectable for much of his adulthood until recently again post Covid. And he does get an elevated heart rate from cardio overly fatigued from what should be a normal amount of activity. Recently it was helpful to hear someone on here suggest that its better to start with strength training to improve endurance and fatigue recovery rather than cardio. Were planning on him starting on that next week. Does anyone have suggestions for apps that are good for doing that at home? That would be great to hear about. I have some experience in this area as a former personal trainer but its been years that Ive built a program for anyone else and I know my husband would love an app! And Im wondering if anyone else has had their hormones affected like (truncated)",['covid-diabetes' 'testing' 'vaccines' 'booster' 'long-hauler'],['health' 'covid'],100,0.0005247746093053,2022-10-16 16:04:39.565389,2022-07-09 04:14:16+00:00,11150438|1253925782022945,"{'platformId': '669615740453955_1253925782022945' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2022-07-09 04:14:16' 'updated': '2022-07-10 12:49:51' 'type': 'status' 'message': 'I\'m a spouse of a Long Covid survivor.

Covid was all negative but when they got the results back for my antibodies test they called me. The Dr said I had most definitely had Covid at some point because my antibodies number was very high. I asked if that could be because of the vaccination and booster I had and he said no your antibodies do not get that high from the vaccination or booster. That was nice to have that confirmed to us that I did indeed have Covid at some point. Anyway I\'m grateful for this group. I actually don\'t post on Facebook but have discovered a lot of value in joining groups like this one. It has helped my husband to see your posts for feeling not so isolated and some validation and lots of good suggestions too. I read them often and in fact probably more than him and I forward some to my husband that I think will particularly help him to read. Everyone is at a different stage of recovery depending on when they got Covid or how many times and how sick they got or what part or parts of their body were affected.... But I want to say to all of you that I feel your pain and suffering and confusion and isolation and I\'m so sorry for everyone who has to go through this!! And I feel your hope too and I just want to say thank you for all your honesty and your suggestions because it is invaluable in a world where all of you are first timers in this awful Covid journey. You\'ve helped me a lot to support my husband too. I will be honest that as a partner it is hard for me to see my husband struggle especially energy wise but I know it\'s hardest for him. But I want to say we should also be remembering that along with the long Covid survivor\'s suffering the family who is living with the long Covid survivor is also going through disappointments in what this illness does or has done to our loved ones. It\'s never easy for the person suffering through it or the supportive family watching the loss of health too. Back to my husband\'s long Covid symptoms....Recently my husband\'s doctor ran some tests and it appears based on similar test results done pre Covid pretty regularly (because of his diabetes) that his endocrine system was profoundly affected from having Covid. His testosterone level is half as low as what is considered too low. And many times lower pre Covid. The doctor says that is most certainly why he is having so much fatigue! That was super helpful to get the why for him and me. He has just started hormone testosterone therapy and we\'re hoping that helps him! And he also has a slight heart murmur too. He had one back in his youth but it appeared to have gone away or was undetectable for much of his adulthood until recently again post Covid. And he does get an elevated heart rate from cardio overly fatigued from what should be a normal amount of activity. Recently it was helpful to hear someone on here suggest that it\'s better to start with strength training to improve endurance and fatigue recovery rather than cardio. We\'re planning on him starting on that next week. Does anyone have suggestions for apps that are good for doing that at home? That would be great to hear about. I have some experience in this area as a former personal trainer but it\'s been years that I\'ve built a program for anyone else and I know my husband would love an app! And I\'m wondering if anyone else has had their hormones affected like (truncated)' 'postUrl': 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1253925782022945' 'subscriberCount': 190558

say though please be nice because this is a little scary to me to be putting my personal life out here but you have all helped us so i'm trying to trust this won't backfire on me my husband got covid sept 2021 he has diabetes so we were very worried and extra cautious about isolating for the whole year and a half before he finally got it anyway and he did get pretty sick but not sick enough to be hospitalized thankfully unfortunately he has suffered from major fatigue post covid and just recently we got some answers as to why more about that later we believe i had a undocumented case of covid in the winter/spring of 2020 i got sicker then i had ever been or have been since all the classic symptoms too fever sore throat congestion headache dry cough fatigue and the most horrible body aches ever and all that winter spring and summer i got every other illness going around and really i felt like i was getting mini cases of covid all over again for months i used to say to my husband ""i wonder if it's possible to get covid over and over again"" now i think it may be that the old original symptoms just keep recurring as a type of long covid response because that happened to my husband too for awhile maybe 6 months or so but his fatigue has been the longest lasting symptom recently i was traveling to help my daughter with her new baby and because i had been potentially exposed to covid i got tested before i left with a rapid and pcr and i asked to have an antibodies test done too covid was all negative but when they got the results back for my antibodies test they called me

That is when my nightmare started. I spent many weeks in the hospital back and forth trying to figure out what was going on. I had extreme liver gallbladder and spleen swelling a nasty infection in my stomach and was retaining so much water I looked like I was about to push out twins. I was only 28. I had to stay overnight in the hospital alone since no visitors were allowed. I was away from my family husband and animals and I was miserable. I received a liver biopsy ultrasounds x-rays- you name it. They ran every test on me possible. October is when all my hair started falling out. Clumps and clumps. My long beautiful hair that went to my butt was no longer. I eventually ended up chopping it all off above my shoulders (best choice I ever made ladies. If you are second guessing the short hair cut to help hair loss) Then the pain started in my knees. My elbows my fingers my toes- all my joints. I was miserable and felt like I was crumbling away. I couldn’t walk without a knee brace I could barely sleep. The burning and numbness in my feet kept me up and I was unable to enjoy things. I felt every day/month was something new.. some new crappy feeling or pain or something wrong.. I was diagnosed with Cuada Equina syndrome and needed to have emergency back surgery in 2021 while on vacation. The doctor told me it was due to my discs degenerating (we can only assume this was from covid but not 100%) I did tons of physical therapy and did everything I could to get/feel better. I read posts in this group read comments took all the advice I saw others give and started really dedicating everything to feeling better. I was determined. I remember reading a post in here from someone that said something like “once you start feeling better don’t forget about this group and the people who are still struggling and want to know they can heal too” I always thought “that could never be me” But I was wrong. I am now about 26ish months post covid and I am SO much better than I was 2 years ago. What almost killed me has also fueled a fire in me to get better stay healthy and fight for my life. I still have my bad days but my good days now outweigh my bad days. I am able to work out go on longer walks play with my nieces/nephews not need to take so many naps to get through my days. My fatigue comes and goes but it is still much better than it was. I am able to go out with friends and actually enjoy myself. I have also had short hair for almost 2 years now and I LOVE IT- a total confidence boost when I look in the mirror. My knee pain is almost gone and I no longer need to wear the brace. I’ve lost all of the water weight i gained and my blood work is better then ever. I have a handful of specialists I still see every few months I get blood work every few months as well. Along with ultrasounds to make sure my liver and other organs are doing good. I found an amazing acupuncturist office that has really helped my healing journey. I avoid foods that make me feel like crap and cause my inflammation to go crazy. I take my vitamins daily i walk daily I also have added in b12 shots daily (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS) I drink lions mane tea every day (also recommend this. Helps with brain fog nerve damage and energy) and I smile daily. As I said I still have my bad days my exhausting days my days where I wish I could go back to how i was before COVID. Some days I take small steps some days are huge steps. Some days are backwards steps or I just sit on my butt watch a movie and cry a little. But the last 2 years has taught me a lot and I’ve grown a lot. I appreciate life a lot more. I guess what I’m trying to say is.. YOU WILL GET BETTER. If you are feeling as helpless as I was two years ago just keep on swimming.

105,Survivor Corps,https://www.facebook.com/groups/669615740453955/permalink/1289549045127285,facebook,"Hello everyone. Thank you for letting me into the group. Ill start off by saying Ive had 4 doses of Moderna the first 2 and 2 boosters the last one was in March 2022. I will not be getting any more. I had managed to avoid the big C until 6pm July 14 2022. A friend asked me if I could give her a ride home as her car had broken down. She didnt bother to tell me she had Covid19 because she felt personally that Covid19 was no longer a big deal. She didnt look sick during the 20 minute ride to her house. She coughed a few times but thats normal for her as AC bothers her asthma. July 16th I woke up at 3am feeling like Id been smacked in the head with a bat or something. And my sinuses were on fire. I didnt have a fever and assumed perhaps it was just a bad allergy flare up. Later on that day I got an email from my ""friend"" and she said ""oh I suppose I should tell you I have Covid19 I had it the day you gave me a ride home but dont worry its not a big deal anymore. Youll feel like a cold for a couple days then be fine."" I sat there re-reading it livid. I took a Covid19 home test and it was negative. I took another one and that one was positive I just knew I had it. The next day July 17th I woke up with my throat so swollen I could barely swallow went to the ER they confirmed with a PCR Rapid test I definitely had Covid19. I was running a low grade fever they gave me some steroids to help with the throat swelling and a prescription for Paxlovid. Within hours I was doubled over in pain and had the most vile taste in my throat that was making me gag. I called the ER and they told me those were symptoms of the side effects of Paxlovid. A couple more hours passed and I started to cough up some blood and decided no more Paxlovid for me and threw it in the trash. When I talked to my doctor the next day she said that was the right decision to stop taking it. A few days later the Covid19 made it into my lungs and I had to be put on a nebulizer every 4 hours round the clock so I could breathe. I continued with this for 4.5 weeks before I could finally get off the nebulizer and finally return to work 5 weeks after I tested positive. I now have long haulers I can only work part time 3 days a week every other day as I need a day to rest after working. I still have a headache all the time neck pain by the base of my skull brain fog cant think straight half the time extremely congested sinuses insomnia sleep issues runny nose and mild lingering cough. I get out of breath VERY easily need to use my inhaler every day multiple times a day. Doctor wants to refer me to a Pulmonologist to have my lungs evaluated. So much for Covid19 being mild right? I had worn my mask everywhere in the last 2.5 years the ONE time I didnt because I trusted my friend is when I caught Covid19. My doctor has told me there is no way to know how long this will last (the long haulers symptoms) and she doesnt know of any treatments for it. I am lucky my employer is being patient and allowing me the time I need to get better. I also have an upcoming appointment with an Ear Specialist as after my 4th dose of Moderna I developed Tinnitus. Again my primary care has said its a known side effect of vaxxes but there are no known treatments for it. Im so angry at my ""friend"" for doing this to me. 😡 If she had told me she had Covid I would have worn a mask made her wear several made her sit in the back seat with all the windows open and lysold my vehicle and Id likely have been fine. But nooo she had to make the decision for me that it wasnt a big deal. She was fine in 4 days and Im still a mess 7 weeks later with no idea how long this will go on. Not to mention the financial disaster this has caused me. Single and live alone there was no second income to fall back on. Im glad I found this group my friends who have gotten Covid are lucky that they did not have any long haulers symptoms but its hard because none of them can relate to what Im going through. I just want my life back.

My doctor has told me there is no way to know how long this will last (the long haulers symptoms) and she doesnt know of any treatments for it. I am lucky my employer is being patient and allowing me the time I need to get better. I also have an upcoming appointment with an Ear Specialist as after my 4th dose of Moderna I developed Tinnitus. Again my primary care has said its a known side effect of vaxxes but there are no known treatments for it. I\'m so angry at my ""friend"" for doing this to me. 😡 If she had told me she had Covid I would have worn a mask made her wear several made her sit in the back seat with all the windows open and lysol\'d my vehicle and I\'d likely have been fine. But nooo she had to make the decision for me that it wasnt a big deal. She was fine in 4 days and I\'m still a mess 7 weeks later with no idea how long this will go on. Not to mention the financial disaster this has caused me. Single and live alone there was no second income to fall back on. I\'m glad I found this group my friends who have gotten Covid are lucky that they did not have any long haulers symptoms but its hard because none of them can relate to what I\'m going through. I just want my life back.

the first 2 and 2 boosters the last one was in march 2022 i will not be getting any more i had managed to avoid the big c until 6pm july 14 2022 a friend asked me if i could give her a ride home as her car had broken down she didnt bother to tell me she had covid19 because she felt personally that covid19 was no longer a big deal she didn't look sick during the 20 minute ride to her house she coughed a few times but thats normal for her as ac bothers her asthma july 16th i woke up at 3am feeling like i'd been smacked in the head with a bat or something and my sinuses were on fire i didn't have a fever and assumed perhaps it was just a bad allergy flare up later on that day i got an email from my ""friend"" and she said ""oh i suppose i should tell you i have covid19 i had it the day you gave me a ride home but don't worry its not a big deal anymore you'll feel like a cold for a couple days then be fine"" i sat there re-reading it livid i took a covid19 home test and it was negative i took another one and that one was positive i just knew i had it the next day july 17th i woke up with my throat so swollen i could barely swallow went to the er they confirmed with a pcr rapid test i definitely had covid19 i was running a low grade fever they gave me some steroids to help with the throat swelling and a prescription for paxlovid within hours i was doubled over in pain and had the most vile taste in my throat that was making me gag i called the er and they told me those were symptoms of the side effects of paxlovid a couple more hours passed and i started to cough up some blood and decided no more paxlovid for me and threw it in the trash when i talked to my doctor the next day she said that was the right decision to stop taking it a few days later the covid19 made it into my lungs and i had to be put on a nebulizer every 4 hours round the clock so i could breathe i continued with this for 45 weeks before i could finally get off the nebulizer and finally return to work 5 weeks after i tested positive i now have long haulers i can only work part time 3 days a week every other day as i need a day to rest after working i still have a headache all the time neck pain by the base of my skull brain fog cant think straight half the time extremely congested sinuses insomnia sleep issues runny nose and mild lingering cough i get out of breath very easily need to use my inhaler every day multiple times a day doctor wants to refer me to a pulmonologist to have my lungs evaluated so much for covid19 being mild right i had worn my mask everywhere in the

For five different tests 3 rapid and 2 PCR. Our doctor has a theory see below. And what have your doctors been saying about WHY?! Would appreciate hearing others experiences. Thanks ahead! We have had Covid in our household of four again for 3 weeks now. Its been a little less than year since the last time. We had all the vaccines and boosters for about 7-17 months ago depending on each of our ages. My husband who is diabetic got a second booster about 6 months ago. My teenage son tested positive first July 20th and was very sick with all the Covid classic symptoms but at home quarantined in his room 1.5 weeks delivering food to his door. Wore a mask when moving about the house until day 15 when he finally tested negative for Covid. Then my 10 yr old started feeling sick a week after my older son and two days later on July 29th he tested positive and had chills brief headache brief sore throat brief body aches and minor cough for awhile. He has been quarantined at home but not his room (impossible with younger kids) although has worn a mask everyday all day in our home this whole week since testing positive which I would have a hard time doing! We PCR tested him again Aug 1st and results were positive again on August 3rd. Going to test again Monday the 8th. My husband started testing for Covid starting when our first son came down with it. He has had Long Covid symptoms since after he had Covid Sept 2021. His first PCR this round of Covid was negative but no surprise there because he really didnt have any symptoms. Then a negative rapid. Then started to feel sick and another negative rapid then he got very sick with all the same classic Covid symptoms and has had another negative rapid and another negative Covid PCR and negative strep test done last week. The doctor thinks he has Covid but for some reason is testing negative all 3 rapids and 2 PCRs. His doctors reasoning is that he thinks the new variant is not showing up on the tests and especially if you have had Covid before. He says to assume my husband is positive for Covid and proceed with all the same quarantine and masks precautions.... I tested negative 3 times and only have had chills as a symptom for a few days I kept thinking the AC was too high and maybe a little more tired but I was taking care of everyone too... and that was it. No other symptoms. I have had my antibodies tested at the beginning of the summer and they are very high. Doctor says Im probably one of those undocumented early 2020 Covid cases and who knows maybe I had another undocumented lighter case in 2021. And Im wondering if my recent chills symptom were from my body fighting it?

TLDR: I got covid around Xmas felt a bit better for a couple days leading up to today and then got hit hard with covid symptoms today and had a positive at-home test. I first had symptoms on Dec 24 and on Dec 25 my daughter had a positive PCR at the hospital. I wasn’t tested because it was the emergency room (we were having trouble keeping her temp under 104) and they said there’s no way I had as many symptoms as I did while being in close contact with someone who just had a positive PCR if I wasn’t also positive. Symptoms progressed and peaked over 3 days from Dec 30 to Jan 2 and I felt noticeably better and was finally fever free without medication on Jan 3 and 4… then today I slept until noon had bad myalgia cough and fatigue for a couple hours slept 4-6pm (highly unusual for me to nap) and around 7 or 8pm I was hit with the splitting headache chills sweats basically all of the symptoms which had come and gone over the past week and a half slammed me hard out of nowhere. My mother is… was supposed to be visiting for my birthday next week and she’s in her 70’s so I decided to use a couple of these tests from the most recent batch of free tests that the government sent out. 6 minutes into the 10 minutes waiting for the test results I saw that red line light up. Has anyone else in this group experienced this? Ive heard of this - most sources will say it happens in about 10% of patients but a study conducted at a university in Southern California had roughly 1/3 report rebound symptoms. I cant find anything about how many people actually tested positive. I have been tested countless times since my first infection in 2020 and this is the first positive. My 3 family members who all were quite ill are recovering well and I happen to also be the only one who already had Long Covid when we got Covid this time. I cant help but notice the correlation between already having Long Covid and now having an unusually hard time clearing the infection and Im very interested to know if anyone else with persistent and lasting symptoms has had this experience first infection or not.

Surround yourself with positivity and be sure to smile or at least force a smile daily to tigger serotonin release the happy hormone. The following is a summary of the most frequent Long COVID sequelae from Mayo Clinic. If you identify any of these symptoms be sure to speak to a doctor about them. COVID-19 (coronavirus): Long-term effects COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the #lungs #heart and #brain which increases the risk of long-term health problems. By Mayo Clinic Staff Most people who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within a few weeks. But some people — even those who had mild versions of the disease — continue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery. These people sometimes describe themselves as ""long haulers"" and the conditions have been called post-COVID-19 syndrome or ""long COVID-19."" These health issues are sometimes called post-COVID-19 conditions. Theyre generally considered to be effects of COVID-19 that persist for more than four weeks after youve been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus. Older people and people with many serious medical conditions are the most likely to experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms but even young otherwise healthy people can feel unwell for weeks to months after infection. Common signs and symptoms that linger over time include: #Fatigue #Shortnessofbreath or difficulty breathing #Cough #Jointpain #Chestpain #Memoryloss #brainfog concentration or #sleepproblems Muscle #pain or #headache #Fastorpoundingheartbeat Loss of #smell or taste #Depression or #anxiety #Fever #Dizziness when you stand Worsened symptoms after physical or mental activities Organ damage caused by COVID-19 Although COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health problems. Organs that may be affected by COVID-19 include: Heart. Imaging tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have shown lasting damage to the heart muscle even in people who experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future. Lungs. The type of pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause long-standing damage to the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The resulting scar tissue can lead to long-term breathing problems. Brain. Even in young people COVID-19 can cause strokes seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Some adults and children experience #multisysteminflammatorysyndrome after they have had COVID-19. In this condition some organs and tissues become severely inflamed. #Bloodclots and blood vessel problems COVID-19 can make blood cells more likely to clump up and form clots. While large clots can cause #heartattacks and #strokes much of the heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed to stem from very small clots that block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the heart muscle. Other parts of the body affected by blood clots include the lungs #legs #liver and #kidneys. COVID-19 can also weaken #bloodvessels and cause them to leak which contributes to potentially long-lasting problems with the liver and kidneys. Problems with mood and fatigue People who have severe symptoms of COVID-19 often have to be treated in a hospitals intensive care unit with mechanical assistance such as ventilators to breathe. Simply surviving this experience can make a person more likely to later develop #PTSD post-traumatic stress syndrome depression and anxiety.

109,COVID-19 Long Haulers Support,https://www.facebook.com/groups/373920943948661/permalink/498357454838342,facebook,FAQ: How long will Long COVID last? COVID can be a major assault to your central nervous system regardless of the severity of your infection and the reality is that COVID can be a life changing event. It can take an unpredictably LONG time to recover. When western medicine doesn’t have all of the answers to these mysterious symptoms it’s time to think about what we can do for ourselves. This may mean making some life choices. Some or all of this information may apply to you. Our goal is to get as much information as we can out as fast as possible but some may not apply to everyone. We are seeing that #selfcare #selfadvocacy are necessary in recovery any post viral syndrome. There is a lot you can do a lot to help yourself recover by managing physical and psychological stressors and considering alternative or complimentary healing alternatives such as breathwork and nutrition. #EDUCATION & SELF #ADVOCACY: Educate yourself on the most common underlying conditions we are seeing: Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and dysautonomia are two of them. Read evidence based research and scholarly articles about your symptoms posted here in the group every day. Avoid social media and media outlets that publish partial concepts to evoke emotions to gain readers versus informing you of what you can do to help yourself. #HISTAMINES: Pay attention to #histamine triggers (foods medications supplements) many of which can be addressed with H1 & H2 antihistamines (Pepcid & and seasonal allergy meds like Zyrtec or Allegra). Always check with your dr before taking new over the counter meds or natural supplements. #LIFESTYLE CHANGES: If you have long COVID it is because something is off balance in your life. It could be emotional nutritional or physical. In order to get better you have to allow yourself time to heal and you need to find a way to moderate those stressors. Change is always uncomfortable but you have more strength than you know. You can do this! OTHER COMMON TOOLS FOR HEALING: •#HealthyEating: Avoid unnecessary chemicals preservatives and high sugar/high carb foods; eat fresh fruits and vegetables; find a few easy and basic recipes you can cook at home instead of eating take out or fast foods. •#Hydrate: Aim for eight 8 oz glasses of water daily; avoid drinks with alcohol and caffeine that stress your heart and kidneys. •#Sleep hygeine: Develop a routine that includes winding down a few hours before bed to slow your mind and body down such as a warm bath or shower meditation visualization positive affirmations (“I will sleep through the night and wake up cheery and feeling better”). •#StressManagement: Avoid or at least reduce #mental AND #physical #stress; make a deliberate effort to replace negative and fearful thoughts with positive messages and affirmations; celebrate every little success. Avoid overexertion don’t push your body physically and pace yourself. •Move and #breathe every day: Start with gentle stretches #breathwork and gentle exercises like a short walk or qigong. Make sure you get fresh air every day am for 10 deep slow breaths at least twice a day to calm your nervous system and heal your body. The human body is delicate. It needs the right fuel time to recharge and heal and life balance through #selfcare and #stressmanagement. Western medicine can only do so much to help. There is no magic pill to fix this. Stay strong. Remember to use the group 🔍# tool to learn about what is happening and what you can do to help yourself get better.

Vaccines are now ""optional."" But no word yet Norwegians stand to require vaccines that has caused a standoff with Florida Gov. DeSantis who has banned businesses --including cruise lines --from requiring proof of vaccination. From the article: Cruise giant Royal Caribbean International on Friday announced plans to bring back six more ships — including some of its largest — for U.S. sailings starting July 2.

in an effort to protect our community against the most recent surge of covid-19 fulton county schools has updated its proactive strategies based on the latest centers for disease control and prevention and georgia department of public health recommendations 

isolation: anyone who tests positive for the virus must isolate at home for five (5) days after the 5-day isolation period students/staff can return to school if they are asymptomatic and continue to wear a mask around others for five (5) additional days it is very important that parents keep their children home if they are exhibiting covid-19 symptoms (even beyond the 5 days if their symptoms have not improved or resolved) 

quarantine: students and staff who have been directly exposed due to a school exposure to covid-19 can stay in school as long as they continue to wear a mask for ten (10) days after the exposure (as long as they remain symptom free/asymptomatic) 

the district will continue to closely monitor healthcare guidelines and will adapt its protocols as needed we also strongly encourage families to participate in the vaccination and testing opportunities available to ensure we can have school with minimal disruptions to the learning process please follow public health guidelines and report any positive covid-19 cases to the parent or employee portals",27,0.0,0.482182837373502

Testing minimum of 30% or more 2 x a week with all data posted daily to school dashboards is so important in finding and quarantining all asymptomatic transmission.  

Ideally the testing would be daily.  

Without it there is no way to find the 30% to 55% of students and staff that are asymptomatic.  The silent spreaders.  

   Quarantining siblings of those cases is necessary to prevent transmission to other classrooms and schools. If we implemented these protocols along with all the other layers of mitigation then we would have a good chance of making schools safer then outside of school.

Summary for September 3 2021

Testing Testing: School Edition

"" Many people with COVID-19 don’t have symptoms but can still spread the virus. With regular testing people can learn their COVID-19 status and use prevention measures before they spread the virus to others. This is especially important for children under 12 years old who are not yet eligible for vaccination. Finding out who has the virus early means that steps can be taken to prevent COVID-19 from spreading and causing an outbreak which helps schools stay open. Regular testing also means parents or guardians get notified if their child tests positive allowing them to plan for treatment and to quarantine or isolate as needed.

Safely returning to in-person instruction this fall is a priority because students benefit from learning in the classroom. Vaccination is the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic but children under 12 years are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. To keep school communities safe and to maintain in-person instruction CDC recommends schools layer multiple prevention strategies. These include universal indoor masking physical distancing hand washing and vaccination for all eligible people. Regular testing in addition to other important prevention measures will help keep students in the classroom and will allow them to participate in the other activities they enjoy.""

#Roommates as the 2021 school year begins nationwide many states are grappling with how to keep students and faculty as safe as possible despite COVID-19 numbers surging due to the Delta variant—and now California has just taken a historic first step. In a recent announcement California is now the very first state in the country to require teachers and school employees to get vaccinated or commit to regular COVID-19 testing.
___________________
@Newsweek reports during a press conference earlier today California Governor Gavin Newsom formally announced the enforcement of a mask mandate in all state schools. Both teachers and school employees are now required to either receive the COVID-19 vaccine or submit to regular testing. This decision now makes California the first state in the country to enforce a vaccine mandate—which impacts over 319000 teachers in the state and is likely a decision that more states are sure to follow.

168,unbiasedscipod,https://www.instagram.com/p/CpnQdWBuJOf/,instagram,"On January 30th the White House announced its plans to end the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and COVID-19 National Emergency on May 11th. This will have several ramifications for the funding of various pandemic-related measures such as vaccines treatments and tests. Here is a summary of some of the changes that will occur when these emergencies officially end.

COVID-19 tests (both at-home and laboratory) will no longer be required to be fully covered by private insurance Medicare and Medicaid. Though insurance may still cover these tests there may be restrictions to in-network sources as well as implementation of cost-sharing and a requirement for laboratory tests to be ordered by a physician. Medicaid will still cover tests ordered by an in-network physician but coverage will vary between states for at-home tests.

Similarly COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be required to be fully required by insurance. Cost-sharing may be imposed and coverage may be denied if vaccination is done out-of-network. Uninsured people will continue to have to rely on the charity of providers for access to COVID-19 vaccines free of charge as federal funding for COVID-19 services for uninsured people ran out in April 2022.

COVID-19 treatments such as Paxlovid or monoclonal antibodies will no longer be covered by the federal government once the emergencies end. Medicare will still cover antiviral treatments until the federal supply of those specific drugs runs out after which patients will have to share costs. Medicaid will only reimburse the cost of FDA approved treatments while coverage for treatments with Emergency Use Authorization will vary between states.

Insurance enrollment could drop considerably after the emergencies officially end. Pandemic-related waivers for enrollment will cease to be in effect and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (which prevents Medicaid from disenrolling people without insurees first requesting it) will also cease to be in effect. These factors contribute to the estimated 18 million people that could lose coverage in the 14 months after the emergencies end.",['testing' 'vaccines' 'treatments'],['health' 'trusted'],2438,0.0107295004048868,2023-04-12 05:30:14.888601,2023-03-10 15:26:50+00:00,14845281|3055483257454367647,{'platformId': '3055483257454367647_39150550684' 'platform': 'Instagram' 'date': '2023-03-10 15:26:50' 'updated': '2023-04-05 14:59:43' 'type': 'album' 'description': 'On January 30th the White House announced its plans to end the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and COVID-19 National Emergency on May 11th.

169,COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS,https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/1194837637952582,facebook,The uninsured program stopped accepting claims for COVID-19 testing and treatment on March 22 2022 and will not accept claims for vaccinating uninsured people after April 5. Hospitals community health centers and pharmacies around the U.S. are already confronting the end of federal funding; many tell [Time Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) they are worried that without a way to pay for testing treating and vaccinating the 31 million Americans without insurance the U.S. may be left flat-footed in the next phase of the pandemic. ‘Pulled the rug out from under us’ When Dr. Wendy Williams the chief medical officer for Coastal Family Health Center a group of community health centers along Mississippi’s gulf coast found out last month that the federal COVID-19 program for uninsured people was ending due to a lack of funding it felt “like somebody pulled the rug out from under us” she says. Her clinics’ patients include many Spanish and Vietnamese speakers migrant workers and people who work on ships docked in the area’s ports. About 50% of them do not have health insurance. Some large labs that have received significant funds from the program have already changed their policies. Quest Diagnostics which operates one of the largest networks of labs in the country has notified clients that they can no longer expect to be reimbursed for testing uninsured patients. Those without insurance can now pay $125 through QuestDirect or $100 if they order through a physician affiliated with Quest. Labcorp’s at-home COVID-19 testing kits now cost $119 for those without insurance. And Curative which operates 13000 testing sites across 18 states has stopped providing testing to uninsured patients in all locations where there are not other funds in place to pay for the cost. The company is working with state and local partners to explore other backup funds for uninsured patients and is piloting programs to charge for testing at two sites but in states with large numbers of uninsured residents the lack of federal funding could mean many cannot access testing. “We are deeply concerned about this recent development and the impact it will have on uninsured patients” said Pasquale Gianni a Curative spokesman. https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA **#community** **#work** **#people** **#health** **#covid** **#medical** **#development** **#funding** **#healthinsurance** **#insurance** When Senators announced on Monday that they reached a deal for $10 billion in additional funding for the coronavirus response many public health experts were dismayed that the package will not include aid for vaccines abroad.

Hospitals community health centers and pharmacies around the U.S. are already confronting the end of federal funding; many tell [Time Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) they are worried that without a way to pay for testing treating and vaccinating the 31 million Americans without insurance the U.S. may be left flat-footed in the next phase of the pandemic. ‘Pulled the rug out from under us’ When Dr. Wendy Williams the chief medical officer for Coastal Family Health Center a group of community health centers along Mississippi’s gulf coast found out last month that the federal COVID-19 program for uninsured people was ending due to a lack of funding it felt “like somebody pulled the rug out from under us” she says. Her clinics’ patients include many Spanish and Vietnamese speakers migrant workers and people who work on ships docked in the area’s ports. About 50% of them do not have health insurance. Some large labs that have received significant funds from the program have already changed their policies. Quest Diagnostics which operates one of the largest networks of labs in the country has notified clients that they can no longer expect to be reimbursed for testing uninsured patients. Those without insurance can now pay $125 through QuestDirect or $100 if they order through a physician affiliated with Quest. Labcorp’s at-home COVID-19 testing kits now cost $119 for those without insurance. And Curative which operates 13000 testing sites across 18 states has stopped providing testing to uninsured patients in all locations where there are not other funds in place to pay for the cost. The company is working with state and local partners to explore other backup funds for uninsured patients and is piloting programs to charge for testing at two sites but in states with large numbers of uninsured residents the lack of federal funding could mean many cannot access testing. “We are deeply concerned about this recent development and the impact it will have on uninsured patients” said Pasquale Gianni a Curative spokesman. https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA **#community** **#work** **#people** **#health** **#covid** **#medical** **#development** **#funding** **#healthinsurance** **#insurance**' 'expandedLinks': [{'original': 'https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#' 'expanded': 'https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#'} {'original': 'https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA' 'expanded': 'https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA'} {'original': 'https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA' 'expanded': 'https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA'}] 'link': 'https://apple.news/AWOvRjGHARcWZxx-eY9XUUA' 'postUrl': 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/1194837637952582' 'subscriberCount': 36726 'score': -1.9230769230769231 'media': [{'type': 'photo' 'url': 'https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?w=500&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fc.apple.news%2FAgEXQVdPdlJqR0hBUmNXWnh4LWVZOVhVVUEAMA&cfs=1&ext=emg0&_nc_oe=70124&_nc_sid=06c271&_nc_o2e=1&ccb=3-6&_nc_hash=AQEhw86Y6s0NdWgf' 'height': 500 'width': 500 'full': 'https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc.apple.news%2FAgEXQVdPdlJqR0hBUmNXWnh4LWVZOVhVVUEAMA&ext=emg0&_nc_oe=70124&_nc_sid=64c8fc&_nc_o2e=1&ccb=3-6&_nc_hash=AQFHTbTzmIaGDoVX'}] 'statistics': {'actual': {'likeCount': 2 'shareCount': 3 'commentCount': 0 'loveCount': 0 'wowCount': 2 'hahaCount': 0 'sadCount': 5 'angryCount': 1 'thankfulCount': 0 'careCount': 0} 'expected': {'likeCount': 5 'shareCount': 3 'commentCount': 4 'loveCount': 2 'wowCount': 2 'hahaCount': 1 'sadCount': 4 'angryCount': 4 'thankfulCount': 0 'careCount': 2}} 'account': {'id': 9994459 'name': 'COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS' 'profileImage': 'https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/87975816_219325059118395_2773522358852386816_n.jpg?stp=c5.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ac9ee4&_nc_ohc=pi-zndZlk1UAX-3BhIS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-C45hgAoEwiefk8_rmJswIkrTeMYOfYji1-Xkj_Nz7UA&oe=637193F7' 'subscriberCount': 37285 'url': 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'platformId': '660816481354703' 'accountType': 'facebook_group' 'pageCategory': 'none' 'verified': False} 'languageCode': 'en' 'legacyId': 0 'id': '9994459|1194837637952582'},,,the uninsured program stopped accepting claims for covid-19 testing and treatment on march 22 2022 and will not accept claims for vaccinating uninsured people after april 5 hospitals community health centers and pharmacies around the us are already confronting the end of federal funding;

⁠
As reported by #balleralert at the beginning of the pandemic the #USgovernment arranged a program to reimburse hospitals and clinics for any care they performed on uninsured patients this included hospital stays COVID-19 testing and antibody treatments. However the $15 billion funding package for pandemic coverage is still stalled in Congress and now the program says it’s no longer accepting claims “due to lack of sufficient funds.”⁠
⁠
One of the largest testing networks in the country Quest Diagnostics announced that they have started informing uninsured patients that “they can’t get it for free” spokesperson Kimberly B. Gorode said.⁠
⁠
If they seek testing they will be charged $125 or $100 if they see a doctor. As for vaccinations they will no longer be free for the uninsured NPR reported.⁠
⁠
The lack of funding has also negatively impacted shipments of monoclonal antibodies which has caused the government to cut the amount sent to states by 35%.

The Biden administration warn that this is just the beginning citing a long list of consequences — short and long term — as they plead with lawmakers to allocate $22.5 billion more for pandemic relief.

At the moment that request for funding appears stalled in Congress.

172,COVID-19 Long Haulers Support,https://www.facebook.com/groups/373920943948661/permalink/585557496118337,facebook,Long COVID is overwhelming and this support group is here to help members navigate this condition through education research and resources. Unfortunately some trolls usurped this group yesterday putting over 100 disruptive comments into discussion threads. Then these trolls started messaging group members and me with threats and insults. I want to take a moment to address this then hopefully we can all move on without too much disruption. First and foremost this group is here to stay. When I started this group Fb did the most thorough background check on me I have ever seen. This group is considered a valid COVID resource to the public and we are committed to helping group members navigate Long COVID. Many people ask why member posts are so rarely published? We have over 52k members today and we get ~1700 new members weekly. Many people immediately submit posts. Most of them are (understandably) sad and full of fear. Some of them are spams and others are full of misinformation. We have heard from group members that the sadness and fear in the valid member posts get overwhelming and cause stress. And as we know stress makes us sicker. So we came up with an alternative - the WEEKLY HOT TOPICS post. It’s pinned in announcements and members can comment there and get immediate community interaction without having to wait for posts to be approved. Very few topics are off limits as long as you focus on your experience and sharing valid information you have found while avoiding sharing opinions or telling others what they should do. We use the main feed to share education research and resources as well as positive stories to give members hope. This is the only way we can manage this group and keep people focused on recovery and healing and filter the spammers and trolls out. Along those lines we have put some safeguards in place. If any group member sees a spam or a negative insulting or otherwise disturbing comment please report it to admins and we will review it. We have a rule set up that any post that is reported twice will automatically mute the person making the troublesome comments and alert us. Trolls spammers and bullies are removed to help minimize the drama so we can focus on the most important thing… healing. This is an amazing community something of a family really. Here you are safe to ask questions and talk to others about your symptoms free of negativity and criticism. We won’t let anything disrupt that. We are here for you. So keep moving keep breathing. You are stronger than you know but when you’re feeling weak we will give you a hand up because we are all in this together. -Laney Brought to you by covidCAREgroup.org connecting the dots of long COVID through education research and resources.,['testing' 'long-hauler'],['health' 'covid'],638,0.0119043176474978,2022-10-15 16:36:58.256869,2021-10-04 05:29:34+00:00,13487526|585557496118337,{'platformId': '373920943948661_585557496118337' 'platform': 'Facebook' 'date': '2021-10-04 05:29:34' 'updated': '2022-05-15 00:12:56' 'type': 'photo' 'message': 'Long COVID is overwhelming and this support group is here to help members navigate this condition through education research and resources.

Education 2. Research 3. Resources 1. Education: Knowledge is power. We started a blog to share facts information and scientific discoveries using evidence based research. With this information you will be in a better position to advocate for yourself and partner with your healthcare providers to develop the best treatment plan for you. https://www.covidcaregroup.org/blog 2. Research: We partner with the world’s leading agencies and universities with the goal of understanding all aspects of COVID. The information gathered is used for scientific advancement in treating this disease and it’s sequelae. When you participate in our research you are making a difference. https://www.covidcaregroup.org/research 3. Resources: We are partnering with like minded people and organizations offering vetted resources to help our community. Along these lines we put an afforadable telehealth plan together (US only) for: • People who want/need to avoid the extra trips to the dr and ER. • People who lose their insurance. • People who aren’t working and can’t afford a lot of copays. • People who are too fatigued or sick to drive to the dr office. • People who live in remote areas with little access to medical care. • People who are taking care of sick children or loved ones who can’t leave the house. https://www.covidcaregroup.org/telehealth Most importantly we want to help our community members avoid unnecessary exposures in hospitals urgent care centers and doctors offices where the very sickest and most contagious people are. The telehealth is $20/month ($25/month for families) for unlimited 24/7 access to COVID knowledgable doctors who can do everything a PCP can except an annual physical. Services include pediatrics medication refills diagnostic tests even things like mammogram orders. There are no copays and no insurance required. Enroll any time for telehealth access starting on the 1st of the following month. Participation is 100% optional in all aspects of this group. Keep moving keep breathing. Stay safe.

183,Black News Network (BNN),https://www.facebook.com/groups/249474009650361/permalink/546920243239068,facebook,According to a memorandum that was obtained by the media players who refuse to get inoculated will be subjected to very rigorous and frequent testing by the league during the 2021-22 season. Such players are going to be tested before each practice and travel days and then again on game days. Other mandates for unvaccinated players include the requirement to wear a mask at all team facilities and when the squad travels. Most cumbersome is that the NBA is ordering teams to segregate non-vaccinated players from their vaccinated teammates. Teams will have to arrange seating during travel meals meetings even locker-room setups to where the unvaccinated players are not sitting next to one another nor near any of the vaccinated teammates. Vaccinated players can be subjected to testing if they exhibit symptoms. So far the NBA and NBA Players Association are still in negotiations on a few issues but the NBAPA has not mandated that every player get the vaccination.

Such players are going to be tested before each practice and travel days and then again on game days. Other mandates for unvaccinated players include the requirement to wear a mask at all team facilities and when the squad travels. Most cumbersome is that the NBA is ordering teams to segregate non-vaccinated players from their vaccinated teammates. Teams will have to arrange seating during travel meals meetings even locker-room setups to where the unvaccinated players are not sitting next to one another nor near any of the vaccinated teammates. Vaccinated players can be subjected to testing if they exhibit symptoms. So far the NBA and NBA Players Association are still in negotiations on a few issues but the NBAPA has not mandated that every player get the vaccination.

209,Andre Dickens,https://www.facebook.com/100058328130805/posts/343728447581424,facebook,Since the start of the campaign season I have been required to keep an active schedule. Accordingly I have regularly been tested for COVID-19. Because the Omicron variant has been surging I increased my testing frequency to every other day. Today I tested positive for COVID-19 with a rapid test and am awaiting the results of a PCR test. First I am feeling well and have only experienced mild symptoms. I cannot be certain where or when I was exposed but if you have come into contact with me during the past week I would urge you to get tested and to quarantine like I am until you’ve received a negative test result.
