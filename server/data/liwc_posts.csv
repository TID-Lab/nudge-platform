11,65,negemo,"Excerpts Instead of relying solely on case counts to gauge the size of a wave, Nash said, it‚Äôs better to take into account other metrics such as hospitalizations and wastewater data, to triangulate what‚Äôs going on. Positivity rate‚Äîthe percent of tests taken that have a positive result‚Äîcan be more informative than looking at the raw numbers, too. And right now, the nationwide positivity rate is telling us that an increasing number of people are getting sick: Nationwide, 6.7 percent of COVID tests are coming back positive, versus 5.3 percent last week. Unlike traditional COVID testing, wastewater surveillance, which is a process of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in public sewage, doesn‚Äôt reveal who exactly might be infected in a particular community. But by analyzing sewer data for evidence of the coronavirus, it can provide an early signal that a surge is happening, in part because people may shed virus in their feces before they start feeling sick. Nationwide levels of COVID in wastewater have climbed steadily in the past six weeks, suggesting more of a wave than the case counts indicate, though they vary greatly by region and can‚Äôt account for the chunk of the population who doesn‚Äôt use public utilities. The course of the pandemic would be far less uncertain if we had data that truly reflected what was happening across the country. All the experts I spoke with agreed that the U.S. desperately needs active surveillance, the kind that involves deliberately testing representative samples of the population to produce unbiased results. It would tell us what percentage of the general population is actually infected, and how trends differ by age and location. Now that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre moving away from blunt tools like mandates, we need data to inform more targeted interventions that are aimed at reducing transmission."" Even if BA.2 is silently infecting large swaths of the country, it doesn‚Äôt seem to yet be causing as much severe illness as previous waves, thanks to immunity and perhaps also antiviral drugs. If that trend holds, it may mean we are seeing a decoupling of cases and hospitalizations (and, thus, with deaths too). ‚ÄúThis is the kind of thing we really want to see‚Äîwe can absorb a big surge without a lot of people having severe infection and dying,‚Äù Nash said. Still, it‚Äôs impossible to say for certain. For that, yet again, we‚Äôd need better data.

15,44,negemo,"üò±üò± ‚ÄúThe National Education Association, America's largest teachers' union, is holding a vote on requiring mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, masks and testing for students before classes return in the fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe action item calls for ‚Äòmandatory safe and effective COVID-19 vaccinations and testing for all students and staff before returning to face-to-face instruction in the fall, subject to medical exceptions, in accordance with existing law, and will widely publicize this position via social media.‚Äô Corey DeAngelis, national director of research at School Choice Now, first highlighted the action item on Twitter.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe description continues: ‚ÄòWe will further call for and publicize that safety measures such as social distancing, masking, and proper ventilation be mandatory for all.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúDeAngelis pointed to a ‚Äòmassive power imbalance between the teachers union monopoly and individual families‚Äô as the ‚Äòmain problem with K-12 education in America‚Äô in a response to the action item on Twitter.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in January that there is ‚Äòlittle evidence‚Äô schools ‚Äòhave contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.‚Äô In February, the agency said the adverse effects of virtual learning outweigh the threat of transmitting the virus during in-school learning.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn mid-March, the CDC updated its K-12 school reopening guidelines to say schools can safely reopen while enforcing just 3 feet of social distancing between students with mandatory mask usage. The guidelines also do not require teacher vaccinations in order for schools to reopen.‚Äù Why are teachers unions acting in this manner and will parents continue to sit back and let the leaders of our failed education system continue to control the narrative?

31,68,relig,"In case you‚Äôve been missing Fred like I have‚Ä¶a cautionary tale, but he‚Äôll be back on Monday! #TGBTG Dear family,

I hope you don‚Äôt find me too presumptuous calling you family. But, that‚Äôs who you are to me. So, let‚Äôs just go with it. üôÇ 

You may have noticed that I have been gone for a few weeks from WSB-TV and social. I like long vacations but even I have my limits. The long and short of it is that Covid found my family with a bullseye. While on vacation in California members of my immediate family came down with Covid. We took all the precautions, got the vaccinations and it still happened. We quarantined, tested like crazy and hoped for the best. My family appears to be doing just fine now. Thank you for thinking of them. 

At the end of the vacation after receiving two negative tests I eventually tested positive. Breakthrough positives as they are known are very real. Arggghhh!!!! I thought because I was fully vaccinated the symptoms would be mild. They were not. 

Over the past two weeks I have struggled to breathe. I‚Äôve acted like the biggest baby through aches and pains. And, I lost my ability to taste and smell. Luckily that part is slowly starting to return. I think I smelled peanut butter today. Optimism is high!  

My doctor told me the fact that I got the vaccination and stayed in relatively good shape kept me out of the hospital. It‚Äôs been a big reminder that health is the true wealth. I want us all to be healthy my friends. 

Also, something interesting. At times During this ordeal where so much seemed out of my control‚ÄîI had anxiety. I was emotional. I was scared. I expected none of this. It‚Äôs been a journey that I know so many others have gone through as well. 

Thank you for thinking about me and taking the time listen to my story. It‚Äôs an honor to wake you up every morning. These last few weeks have reminded me how truly blessed I am to have my family, friends and this amazing job. I feel like the luckiest man alive. 

The bottom line is I feel so much better and I‚Äôm back baby. Well,  almost back. I‚Äôll
see you wonderful people on Monday!  Until then stay positive and healthy. Let‚Äôs get it!!!!

44,65,anger,"Excerpts Instead of relying solely on case counts to gauge the size of a wave, Nash said, it‚Äôs better to take into account other metrics such as hospitalizations and wastewater data, to triangulate what‚Äôs going on. Positivity rate‚Äîthe percent of tests taken that have a positive result‚Äîcan be more informative than looking at the raw numbers, too. And right now, the nationwide positivity rate is telling us that an increasing number of people are getting sick: Nationwide, 6.7 percent of COVID tests are coming back positive, versus 5.3 percent last week. Unlike traditional COVID testing, wastewater surveillance, which is a process of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in public sewage, doesn‚Äôt reveal who exactly might be infected in a particular community. But by analyzing sewer data for evidence of the coronavirus, it can provide an early signal that a surge is happening, in part because people may shed virus in their feces before they start feeling sick. Nationwide levels of COVID in wastewater have climbed steadily in the past six weeks, suggesting more of a wave than the case counts indicate, though they vary greatly by region and can‚Äôt account for the chunk of the population who doesn‚Äôt use public utilities. The course of the pandemic would be far less uncertain if we had data that truly reflected what was happening across the country. All the experts I spoke with agreed that the U.S. desperately needs active surveillance, the kind that involves deliberately testing representative samples of the population to produce unbiased results. It would tell us what percentage of the general population is actually infected, and how trends differ by age and location. Now that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre moving away from blunt tools like mandates, we need data to inform more targeted interventions that are aimed at reducing transmission."" Even if BA.2 is silently infecting large swaths of the country, it doesn‚Äôt seem to yet be causing as much severe illness as previous waves, thanks to immunity and perhaps also antiviral drugs. If that trend holds, it may mean we are seeing a decoupling of cases and hospitalizations (and, thus, with deaths too). ‚ÄúThis is the kind of thing we really want to see‚Äîwe can absorb a big surge without a lot of people having severe infection and dying,‚Äù Nash said. Still, it‚Äôs impossible to say for certain. For that, yet again, we‚Äôd need better data.  No one‚Äôs actually sure.",COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FACTS,facebook,https://www.facebook.com/groups/660816481354703/permalink/1209601266476219,facebook_9994459|1209601266476219,9994459|1209601266476219
